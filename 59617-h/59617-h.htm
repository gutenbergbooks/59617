</span><span class="hidden">S</span>URELY it was no longer
ago than yesterday. I had
left the scythe lying at the
edge of the long grass, and
gone up through the rows
of nodding Indian corn to
the house, seeking a draught
of cool water from the
spring. It was hot in the
July sunshine; the thick forest on every side intercepted
the breeze, and I had been at work for some
hours. How pleasant and inviting the little river
looked in the shade of the great trees, while, as I
paused a moment bending over the high bank, I could
see a lazy pike nosing about among the twisted roots
below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span></p>

<p>My mother, her sleeves rolled high over her round
white arms, was in the dark interior of the milk-house
as I passed, and spoke to me laughingly; and I could
perceive my father sitting in his great splint-bottomed
chair just within the front doorway, and I marked
how the slight current of air toyed with his long gray
beard. The old Bible lay wide open upon his knee;
yet his eyes were resting upon the dark green of the
woods that skirted our clearing. I wondered, as I
quaffed the cool sweet water at the spring, if he was
dreaming again of those old days when he had been a
man among men. How distinct in each detail the
memory of it remains! The blue sky held but one
fleecy white cloud in all its wide arch; it seemed as if
the curling film of smoke rising from our chimney had
but gathered there and hung suspended to render the
azure more pronounced. A robin peeked impudently
at me from an oak limb, and a roguish gray squirrel
chattered along the low ridge-pole, with seeming willingness
to make friends, until Rover, suddenly spying
me, sprang hastily around the corner of the house to
lick my hand, with glad barkings and a frantic effort
to wave the stub of his poor old tail. It was such a
homely, quiet scene, there in the heart of the backwoods,
one I had known unchanged so long, that I
little dreamed it was soon to witness the turning over
of a page of destiny in my life, that almost from
that hour I was to sever every relation of the past,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
and be sent forth to buffet with the rough world
alone.</p>

<p>There were no roads, in those days, along that
valley of the upper Maumee,&mdash;merely faint bridle-paths,
following ancient Indian trails through dense
woods or across narrow strips of prairie-land; yet as
I hung the gourd back on its wooden peg, and lifted
my eyes carelessly to the northward, I saw a horseman
riding slowly toward the house along the river bank.
There were flying rumors of coming Indian outbreaks
along the fringe of border settlements; but my young
eyes were keen, and after the first quick thrill of suspicion
I knew the approaching stranger to be of white
blood, although his apparel was scarcely less uncivilized
than that of the savage. Yet so unusual were
visitors, that I grasped a gun from its pegs in the
kitchen, and called warningly to my mother as I
passed on to meet the new-comer.</p>

<p>He was a very large and powerful man, with a
matted black beard and an extremely prominent nose.
A long rifle was slung at his back, and the heavy bay
horse he bestrode bore unmistakable signs of hard
travelling. As he approached, Rover, spying him,
sprang out savagely; but I caught and held him
with firm grip, for to strangers he was ever a surly
brute.</p>

<p>"Is this yere Major Wayland's place?" the man
questioned, in a deep, gruff voice, reining in his tired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
horse, and carelessly flinging one booted foot across
the animal's neck as he faced me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I responded with caution, for we were
somewhat suspicious of stray travellers in those days,
and the man's features were not pleasing. "The
Major lives here, and I am his son."</p>

<p>He looked at me intently, some curiosity apparent
in his eyes, as he deliberately drew a folded paper
from his belt.</p>

<p>"No? Be ye the lad what downed Bud Eberly
at the meetin' over on the Cow-skin las' spring?" he
questioned, with faintly aroused interest.</p>

<p>I blushed like a school-girl, for this unexpected
reference was not wholly to my liking, though the
man's intentions were evidently most kind.</p>

<p>"He bullied me until I could take no more," I
answered, doubtfully; "yet I hurt him more seriously
than I meant."</p>

<p>He laughed at the trace of apology in my words.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he ejaculated, "don't ever let that worry
ye, boy. The hull settlement is mighty glad 'twas
done. Old Hawkins bin on the p'int o' doin' it himself
a dozen o' times. Told me so. Ye're quite a
lad, ain't ye? Weigh all o' hundred an' seventy, I'll
bet; an' strong as an ox. How old be ye, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Twenty," I answered, not a little mollified by
his manner. "You must live near here, then?"</p>

<p>"Wal, no, but been sorter neighbor o' yourn fer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
a month er so back; stoppin' up at Hawkins's shebang,
at the ford, on the Military Road, visitin'; but
guess I never met up with none o' your folks afore.
My name's Burns, Ol' Tom Burns, late o' Connecticut.
A sojer from out West left this yere letter
fer yer father at Hawkins's place more nor a week
ago. Said as how it was mighty important; but
blamed if this wasn't the fust chance he's hed to git
it over yere sence. I told him I'd fetch it, as it wasn't
more nor a dozen miles er so outer my way."</p>

<p>He held out a square paper packet; and while I
turned it over curiously in my hand,&mdash;the first letter
I had ever seen,&mdash;he took some loose tobacco from an
outside pocket and proceeded leisurely to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>My mother rolled my father's chair forward into
the open doorway, and stood close behind him, as was
her custom, one arm resting lightly upon the quaintly
carved chair-back.</p>

<p>"What is it, John?" she questioned gently. Instantly
aroused by her voice, I crossed quickly over
and placed the packet in my father's thin hands. He
turned it over twice before he opened it, looking at
the odd seal, and reading the superscription carefully
aloud, as if fearful there might be some mistake:</p>

<p>I can see him yet as he read it, slowly feeling
his way through the rude, uneven writing, with my
mother leaning over his shoulder and helping him,
her rosy cheeks and dark tresses making strange contrast
beside his pain-racked features and iron-gray
hair.</p>

<p>"Read it aloud, Mary," he said at last. "I shall
understand it better. 'Tis from Roger Matherson,

<p>I have come to the end of life; they tell
me it will be all over by the morrow, and there remains but one
thing that greatly troubles me&mdash;my little girl, my Elsa. You
know I have never much feared death, nor do I in this hour when
I face it once more; for I have ever tried to honor God and do my
duty as both man and soldier. David, I can scarcely write, for
my mind wanders strangely, and my fingers will but barely grasp
the pen. 'Tis not the grip of the old sword-hand you knew so
well, for I am already very weak, and dying. But do you yet
remember the day I drew you out of the rout at Saratoga, and
bore you away safely, though the Hessians shot me twice? God
knows, old friend, I never thought to remind you of the act,&mdash;'twas
no more than any comrade would have done,&mdash;yet I am
here among strangers, and there is no one else living to whom I
may turn in my need. David, in memory of it, will you not give
my little orphan child a home? Your old comrade, upon his
death-bed, begs this of you with his final breath. She is all
alone here, save for me, and there is no blood kin in all the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
to whom I may appeal. I shall leave some property, but not
much. As you love your own, I pray you be merciful in this hour
to my little girl.</p>

<p>This had been endorsed by another and bolder
hand:</p>

<p>The tears were clinging to my mother's long
lashes as she finished the reading; she was ever
tender of heart and sympathetic with sorrow. My
father sat in silence, looking far off at the green
woods. Presently he took the paper again into his
hands, folded it carefully in the old creases, and placed
it safely away between the Bible leaves. I saw my
mother's fingers steal along the arm of the chair until
they closed softly over his.</p>

<p>"The poor little lamb!" she said gently.</p>

<p>My father's old sword hung over the fireplace,
and I saw his glance wander toward it, as something
seemed to rise choking in his throat. He was always a
man who felt deeply, yet said but little; and we both
knew he was thinking about the old days and the
strong ties of comradeship.</p>

<p>The stranger struck flint and steel to light his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
pipe; the act instantly recalled my father to the
demands of hospitality.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said, speaking firmly, "hitch to the
stump yonder, and come in. You have brought me
sad news enough, yet are no less welcome, and must
break bread at our board. John," and he turned
toward me, "see to friend Burns's horse, and help
your mother to prepare the dinner."</p>

<p>Out in the rude shed, which answered as a kitchen
during summer weather, I ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"Mother, do you suppose he will take the little
girl?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, John," she answered, soberly; "but
your father must decide himself. He will not tell us
until he has thought it all out alone."</p>

<p class="caption3">THE CALL OF DUTY</p>

<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page9_i.png" width="170" height="167" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T was upon my mind all
through that long afternoon,
as I swung the scythe in
the meadow grass. I saw
Burns ride away up the
river trail soon after I returned to work, and wondered if he bore with him
any message from my father.
It was like a romance to me, to whom so few important
things had ever happened. In some way,
the coming of this letter out of the great unknown
had lifted me above the narrow life of the clearing.
My world had always been so small, such a petty and
restricted circle, that this new interest coming within
its horizon had widened it wonderfully.</p>

<p>I had grown up on the border, isolated from what
men term civilization; and I could justly claim to
know chiefly those secrets which the frontier teaches
its children. My only remembrance of a different
mode of life centred about the ragged streets of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
small New England village, where I had lived in
earlier childhood. Ever since, we had been in the
depths of the backwoods; and after my father's accident
I became the one upon whom the heavier part
of the work fell. I had truly thrived upon it. In
my hunting-trips, during the dull seasons, I learned
many a trick of the forest, and had already borne rifle
twice when the widely scattered settlements were
called to arms by Indian forays. There were no
schools in that country; indeed, our nearest neighbor
was ten miles distant as the crow flies. But my
mother had taught me, with much love and patience,
from her old treasured school-books; and this, with
other lore from the few choice volumes my father
clung to through his wanderings, gave me much to
ponder over. I still remember the evenings when he
read to us gravely out of his old Shakespeare, dwelling
tenderly upon passages he loved. And he instructed
me in other things,&mdash;in honor and manliness, in
woodcraft, and many a pretty thing at arms, until no
lad in the settlements around could outdo me in rough
border sport. I loved to hear him, of a boisterous
winter night,&mdash;he spoke of such matters but seldom,&mdash;tell
about his army life, the men he had fought
beside and loved, the daring deeds born of his younger
blood. In that way he had sometimes mentioned this
Roger Matherson; and it was like a blow to me now
to hear of his death. I wondered what the little girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
would be like; and my heart went out to her in her
loneliness. Scarcely realizing it, I was lonely also.</p>

<p>"Has he spoken yet?" I questioned anxiously
of my mother, as I came up to the open kitchen door
when the evening chores were done.</p>

<p>"No, John," she answered, "he has been sitting
there silently looking out at the woods ever since the
man left. He is thinking, dear, and we must not
worry him."</p>

<p>The supper-table had been cleared away, and
Seth, the hired man, had crept up the creaking ladder
to his bed under the eaves, before my father spoke.
We were all three together in the room, and I had
drawn his chair forward, as was my custom, where
the candle-light flickered upon his face. I knew by
the look of calm resolve in his gray eyes that a decision
had been reached.</p>

<p>"Mary," he began gravely, "and you, John, we
must talk together of this new duty which has just
come to us. I hardly know what to decide, for we are
so poor and I am now so helpless; yet I have prayed
earnestly for guidance, and can but think it must be
God's will that we care for this poor orphan child of
my old friend."</p>

<p>My mother crossed the room to him, and bent
down until her soft cheek touched his lips.</p>

<p>"I knew you would, David," she whispered, in the
tender way she had, her hand pressing back his short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
gray hair. "She shall ever be unto us as our own
little girl,&mdash;the one we lost come back to us again."</p>

<p>My father bent his head wearily upon one hand,
his eyes upon the candle flame, his other hand patting
her fingers.</p>

<p>"It must be all of ten years," he said slowly,
"since last I had word of Roger Matherson. He was
in Canada then, yet has never since been long out of my
mind. He saved my life, not once alone, as he would
seem to remember, but three separate times in battle.
We were children together in the blue Berkshire hills,
and during all our younger manhood were more than
brothers. His little one shall henceforth be as my own
child. God hath given her unto us, Mary, as truly as if
she had been born of our love. I knew that Roger had
married, yet heard nothing of the birth of the child or
the loss of his wife. However, from this hour the orphan
is to be our own; and we must now decide upon
some safe means of bringing her here without delay."</p>

<p>He paused. No one of us spoke. His glance
slowly wandered from the candle flame, until it settled
gravely upon my face as I sat resting on a rude
bench fitted into the chimney corner. He looked so
intently at me that my mother seemed instantly to
interpret his thought.</p>

<p>"Oh, surely not that, David?" she exclaimed,
pleadingly. "Not John?"</p>

<p>"I know of no other fit messenger, little woman,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
he answered soberly. "It has indeed troubled me
far more than all the rest, to decide on this; yet there
is no one else whom I think equal to the task. John is
a good boy, mother, and has sufficient experience in
woodcraft to make the journey."</p>

<p>"But the savages!" she insisted. "'Tis said we
are upon the verge of a fresh outbreak, stirred up by
this new war with England, that may involve the
settlements at any time. You know Burns told you
just now,&mdash;and he is an old scout, familiar with the
West,&mdash;that British agents were active along the
whole border, and there was great uneasiness among
the Indian tribes."</p>

<p>"There is serious promise of danger, 'tis true,"
he admitted, a flash of the old fire in his eyes. "Yet
that is scarce likely to halt David Wayland's son.
Indeed, it is the greater reason why this helpless
orphan child should be early brought to our protection.
Think of the defenceless little girl exposed alone to
such danger! Nor have we means of judging, Mary, of
the real seriousness of the situation to the north and
west. War between the nations may very likely
arouse the spirit of the savages, yet rumors of Indian
outbreak are always on the lips of the settlers. Burns
himself was upon his return westward, and did not
seem greatly troubled lest he fail to get through. He
claimed to live at Chicagou Portage, wherever that
may be. I only know it is the extreme frontier."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span></p>

<p>My mother did not answer; and now I spoke, my
cheeks aflame with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Do you truly mean, sir, that I am to go in search
of the little girl?" I asked, barely trusting my own ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, John," my father replied gravely, motioning
me to draw closer to his chair. "This is a duty
which has fallen to you as well as to your mother and
me. We can, indeed, but poorly spare you from the
work at this season; yet Seth will be able to look after
the more urgent needs of the farm while you are absent,
while he would prove quite useless on such a
mission as this. Do not worry, Mary. Friend Burns
is well acquainted with all that western country, and
he tells me there is scarcely a week that parties of
soldiers, or friendly Indians, do not pass along the
trail, and that by waiting at Hawkins's place for a
few days John will be sure to find some one with
whom he may companion on the long journey westward.
He would himself have accompanied him, but
must first bear a message to friends at Vincennes. It
is now some weeks since Roger Matherson died, and
we shall prove unworthy of our trust if we delay
longer in sending for his daughter."</p>

<p>Though my mother was a western woman, patient
and long habituated to sacrifice and peril, still her
eyes, fixed upon my face, were filled with tears, and
the color had deserted her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I know not why it should be so, David," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span>
urged softly; "but in my heart I greatly fear this trip
for John. Yet you have ever found me ready to yield
wherever it seemed best, and I doubt not you are right
in your decision."</p>

<p>At any other time I should have gone to her with
words of comfort and good cheer; but now my ambition
was so aroused by this impending adventure as
to permit me to think of nothing else.</p>

<p>"Is it so very far, father, to where I must go?"
I questioned, eagerly. "Where is this Fort Dearborn,
and how am I to journey in reaching there? 'Tis no
garrison of which I have ever heard."</p>

<p>"Bring me the map your mother made of this
country, and the regions to the westward," he said.
"I am not over clear in regard to the matter myself,
although friend Burns, who claims to know all that
country, gave me some brief description; but I found
him most chary of speech."</p>

<p>I got the map out of the great square cupboard
in the corner, and spread the paper flat upon the
table, placing knives at each corner to hold it open.
I rolled his chair up before it, and the three of us bent
our heads over the map together, our faces glowing
in the candle flame. It was a copy made by a quill
from a great government map my mother had seen
somewhere in her journeying westward; and, though
only a rude design, it was not badly done, and was
sufficiently accurate for our purpose. Much of it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
still blank; yet the main open trails had been traced
with care, the principal fords over the larger streams
were marked, and the various government posts and
trading settlements distinctly located and named.
Searching for the head of the Great Lake, we were not
long in discovering the position of the fort called
Dearborn, which seemingly was posted upon the
western shore, nearly opposite another garrison point
at the mouth of the St. Joseph river. We were able
to trace with clearness the military road that had been
constructed northward from Fort Wayne, our nearest
government post; but the map failed to exhibit evidence
of any beaten track, or used trail, leading westward
and around the head of the lake. There were
numerous irregular lines which denoted unnamed
streams, but by far the larger portion of the territory
extending to the west beyond Fort Wayne had been
simply designated as "forest land" and "unexplored."
"Friend Burns tells me there is a trail used by
both troops and savages, which he has traversed several
times," my father explained, as he lifted his eyes
from the map; "but it is not over plain, nor easily followed,
as communication with the Fort is mostly maintained
by means of the waterways to the northward.
The overland journey, however, will prove speedier,
besides being less liable to disaster for one unaccustomed
to boats. How soon can John be ready,
mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span></p>

<p>Her voice trembled, and I felt the pressure of her
hand upon my sleeve.</p>

<p>"It will take all of the morrow, David, to prepare
his clothing properly," she replied, with the patient
resignation of the frontier. "There is much that will
need seeing after."</p>

<p>"Then John will start the next dawn. You had
best ride the brown colt, my son; he is of good breed,
and speedy. Seth shall accompany you until you find
suitable companionship at Hawkins's. He will bring
back word of how you started, and that knowledge
will greatly comfort your mother."</p>

<p>He paused, and held out his thin hands.</p>

<p>"You go upon this strange journey willingly, my
son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"You will be both kind and thoughtful with
Roger Matherson's little girl?"</p>

<p>"She shall be to me as my own sister."</p>

<p>I felt the confiding clasp of his fingers, and realized
how much to him would be a successful termination
of my journey.</p>

<p>"Kiss your mother, John," he said, a trustful
look coming into his kindly eyes. "We must all
be astir early on the morrow."</p>

<p>Beneath the rived shingles of my little room,
under the sloping roof, how I turned and tossed
through those long night hours! What visions, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span>
asleep and awake, came to me, thronging fast upon
my heated brain, each more marvellous than its fellow,
and all alike pointing toward that strange country
which I was now destined by fate to travel! Vague
tales of wonder and mystery had come floating to me
out of that unknown West, and now I was to behold
it all with my own eyes. But marvellous as were my
dreams, the reality was to be even more amazing than
these pictures of boyish imagination. Had I known
the truth that night, I doubt greatly whether I should
have had the courage to face it.</p>

<p>At last the gray dawn came, stealing in at the only
window, and found me eager for the trial.</p>

</span>&nbsp;DREW rein upon the upper
river bank, before we finally
plunged into the dark woods
beyond, and glanced back.
I had to brush the gathering tears from my eyes
before I could see clearly;
and when I finally rode
away, the picture of that
dear old home was fixed in my memory forever. Our
house stood near the centre of an oak opening,&mdash;a
little patch of native prairie-land, with a narrow
stream skirting it on one side, and a dense fringe of
forest all about. The small story-and-a-half cabin
of hewn logs, with its lean-to of rough hand-riven
planks, fronted to the southward; and the northern
expanse of roof was green with moss. My father
sat in the open doorway, his uplifted hand shading
his eyes as he gazed after us; while my mother stood
by his side, one arm resting upon the back of his
chair, the other extended, waving a white cloth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
farewell. Rover was without, where I had bidden
him remain, eagerly watching for some signal of relenting
upon my part. Beyond stood the rude out-buildings,
silhouetted against the deep green. It was
a homely, simple scene,&mdash;yet till now it had been all
the world to me.</p>

<p>With a final wave of the hand, I moved forward,
until the intervening trees, like the falling of a curtain,
hid it all from view. Seth was astride the old mare,
riding bareback, his white goat-like beard hanging
down his breast until it mingled with her mane, while
his long thin legs were drawn up in the awkward way
he had. He was a strange, silent, gloomy man, as
austere as his native hills; and we rode on with no
exchange of speech. Indeed, my thoughts were of a
nature that I had no wish to share with another; so
it was some time before the depth of loneliness which
oppressed my spirits enabled me to feel even passing
interest in the things at hand.</p>

<p>"I'd hate like thunder ter be a-goin' on your trip,
Maester John," volunteered Seth at last, solemnly
turning on the mare's broad back to face me.</p>

<p>"And why?" I asked, wonderingly; for the man's
rare gift of silence had won him a certain reputation
for deep, occult knowledge which I could not wholly
ignore. "It will bring me the sight of some wonderful
country, no doubt."</p>

<p>His shrewd gimlet eyes seemed fairly to pierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span>
me, as he deliberately helped himself to tobacco from
a pouch at his waist.</p>

<p>"Wal, that may all be, Maester John; but I've
heerd tell ther is some most awful things goes on out
yonder," and he swung his long arm meaningly toward
the west. "Animyles sich as don't prowl raound yere,
man-yeatin' snakes as big as thet tree, an' the blood-thirstiest
salvages as ever was. An' arter a while ther
ain't no more trees grows, ther Ian' is thet poor, by
gosh! jist a plumb dead levil er' short grass, an' no
show ter hide ner nuthin'."</p>

<p>"Were you ever there, Seth?" I questioned with
growing anxiety, for I had heard some such vague
rumors as these before.</p>

<p>"Me? Not by a dinged sight!" he replied, emphatically.
"This yere is a long way further west
thin I keer 'bout bein'. Ol' Vermont is plenty good
'nough fer this chicken, an' many's ther day I wish
I was back ther. But I hed a cousin onct who tuk ter
sojerin' 'long with Gineral Clarke, an' went 'cross them
ther prairies ter git Vincennes frum the British. Lor'!
it must a' bin more ner thirty year ago! He tol' me
thet they jist hed ter wade up ter ther neck in water fer
days an' days. I ain't so durn fond o' water as all thet.
An' he said as how rattlesnakes was everywhere; an'
ther Injuns was mos' twice es big es they be yere."</p>

<p>"But Clarke, and nearly all of his men, got back
safely," I protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I guess some on 'em got back, 'cause they
was an awful lot in thet army, mighty nigh two
thousand on 'em, Ephriam said; but, I tell ye, they hed
a most terrible tough time afore they did git hum. I
seed my cousin whin he kim back, an' he was jist a
mere shadder; though he was bigger ner you whin
he went 'way."</p>

<p>"But Fort Dearborn is much farther to the north.
Perhaps it will be better up there."</p>

<p>"Wuss," he insisted, with a most mournful shake
of the head, "a dinged sight wuss. Ephriam said es
how the further north ye wint, the tougher it got. He
saw an Injun from up near the big lake&mdash;a Pottamottamie,
or somethin' like thet&mdash;what was nine fut
high, an' he told him es how the rivers in his kintry
was all full o' man-eatin' critters like snakes, an' some
on 'em hed a hundred legs ter crawl with, an' cud
travel a dinged sight faster ner a hoss. By gosh! but
you bet I don't want none on it. Your father must 'a'
been plum crazy fer ter sind ye way out ther all
'lone,&mdash;jist a green boy like you. What ye a-goin'
fer, enyhow?"</p>

<p>I explained to him the occasion and necessity for
my trip, but he shook his head dubiously, his long face
so exceedingly mournful that I could not remain unaffected by it.</p>

<p>"Wal," he said at length, carefully weighing his
words, "maybe it's all right 'nough, but I've got my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span>
doubts jist the same. I'll bet thet ther gal is jist
one o' them will-o'-the-wisps we hear on, an' you
never will find her. You'll jist wander 'round, huntin'
an' huntin' her, till ye git old, or them monsters git
ye. An' I'll be blamed if ever I heerd tell o' no sich
fort as thet, nohow."</p>

<p>Seth was certainly proving a Job's comforter; and
I was already sufficiently troubled about the final outcome
of my adventure. Hence my only hope of retaining
any measure of courage was to discountenance
further conversation, and we continued to jog along
in silence, although I caught him looking at me several
times in a manner that expressed volumes.</p>

<p>We camped that night in the dense heart of some
oak woods, beside a pleasant stream of clear, cool
water. Late the following evening, just as the sun
was disappearing behind the trees, our wearied horses
emerged suddenly upon the bank of a broad river, and
we could discern the dim outlines of Hawkins's buildings
amid the deepening shadows of the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Upon one thing I was now fully determined.
Seth should start back with the first streak of the
next dawn. His long face and dismal croakings kept
me constantly upon nettles, and I felt that I should
face the uncertain future with far stouter heart if he
were out of my sight. Firm in this resolve, I urged my
horse to splash his reluctant way through the shallows
of the ford; and as our animals rose on the steep bank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span>
of the western shore, we found ourselves at once in
the midst of a group of scattered buildings. It seemed
quite a settlement in that dim light, although the
structures were all low and built of logs. The largest
and most centrally located of these was evidently the
homestead, as it had a rudely constructed porch in
front, and a thin cloud of smoke was drifting from its
chimney. As I drew nearer, I could perceive the reflection
of a light streaming out through the open
doorway.</p>

<p>No one appeared in answer to our shouting,&mdash;not
even a stray dog; and, in despair of thus arousing the
inhabitants, I flung my rein to Seth, and, mounting
the doorstep, peered within. As I did so, a shiny,
round, black face, with whitened eyes and huge red
lips, seemed to float directly toward me through the
inner darkness. It was so startling an apparition that
I sprang back in such haste as nearly to topple over
backward from the steps. Heaven alone knows what
I fancied it might be; indeed, I had little enough time
in which to guess, for I had barely touched the ground,&mdash;my
mind still filled with memories of Seth's grotesque
horrors,&mdash;when the whole figure emerged into
view, and I knew him instantly for a negro, though I
had never before seen one of his race. He was a
dandified-looking fellow, wearing a stiff white waistcoat
fastened by gilded buttons, with a pair of short
curly mustaches, waxed straight out at the ends; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
he stood there grinning at me in a manner that showed
all his gleaming teeth. Before I could recover my wits
enough to address him, I heard a voice from within
the house,&mdash;a soft, drawling voice, with a marked
foreign accent clinging to it.</p>

<p>"Sam," it called, "have you found either of the
scoundrelly rascals?"</p>

<p>The darkey started as if shot, and glanced nervously
back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, sah," he replied with vigor, "dat Mistah
Hawkins am not yere, sah. An' dat Mistah Burns has
gone 'way fer gud, sah. But dar am a gemman yere,
sah,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" came a surprised ejaculation that
caused the negro to jump, and I heard a chair overturned
within. "A gentleman? Sam, don't deceive
me! For the love of Heaven, let me see him. May I
be bastinadoed if it hasn't been three months since
my eyes beheld the last specimen! Sam, where was
it I saw the last one?"</p>

<p>"Montreal, sah."</p>

<p>"By Saint Guise! 'tis gospel truth," and the
speaker strode forward, candle in hand. "Here, now,
you ace of spades," he cried impatiently, "hold the
flame until I bid this paragon of the wilderness fit
welcome in the name of Hawkins, who strangely
seems to have vanished from the sylvan scene. Alas,
poor Hawkins! two gentlemen at one time, I greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
fear, will be the death of him. Would that his good
friend Burns might be with him on this festive occasion.
Ye gods, what a time it would be!"</p>

<p>As the black hastily reached out for the candle-stick,
his erratic master as quickly changed his mind.</p>

<p>"No," he muttered thoughtfully, drawing back
within the hall; "'tis far more fit that such formal
greeting should occur within, where the essentials
may be found with which to do full courtesy. I will
instead retire. Sam, bid the gentleman meet me in
the banquet hall, and then, mark you, thou archfiend
of blackness, seek out at once that man Hawkins in
his hidden lair, and bid him have ample repast spread
instantly, on pain of my displeasure. By all the saints!
if it be not at once forthcoming I will toast the scoundrel
over his own slow fire."</p>

<p>"Seth," I said to my staring companion, as soon
as I could recover from my own surprise, "find a
place for the horses somewhere in the stables, and
come in."</p>

<p>"Where is your master to be found?" I questioned
of the black, whose air of self-importance had
been resumed the moment he was left alone.</p>

<p>"Second door to de right, sah," he answered,
gazing curiously at my deer-skin hunting-shirt as I
pressed by.</p>

<p>I had little difficulty in finding it, for all that the
way was totally dark, as the fellow within was lustily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27 </a></span>
carolling a French love-song. I hung back for a
moment, striving vainly to distinguish the words.</p>

<p>Without pausing to make my presence known,
I opened the door quietly, and stepped within. The
room was not a large one, though it occupied the full
width of the house; and the two lighted candles that
illumined it, one sitting upon a table otherwise bare,
the other occupying the rude dresser in the far corner,
revealed clearly the entire interior.</p>

<p>The sole occupant of the room sat upon a corner
of the table, one foot resting on the floor, the other
dangling carelessly. Hardly more than a year my
elder, he bore in his face the indelible marks of a life
vastly different. His features were clear-cut, and undeniably
handsome, with a curl of rare good-humor to
his lips and an audacious sparkle within his dark eyes.
His hat, cocked and ornamented in foreign fashion,
lay beside him; and I could not help noting his long
hair, carefully powdered and arranged with a nicety
almost conspicuous, while his clothing was rich in
both texture and coloring, and exhibited many traces
of vanity in ribbon and ornament. Within his belt,
fastened by a large metal clasp, he wore a pearl-handled
pistol with long barrel; and a rapier, with
richly jewelled hilt, dangled at his side. Altogether
he made a fine figure of a man, and one of a sort I had
never met before.</p>

<p>If he interested me, doubtless I was no less a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28 </a></span>
study to him. I could see the astonishment in his
eyes, after my first entrance, change to amusement as
he gazed. Then he brought a white hand down, with
a smart slap, upon the board beside him.</p>

<p>"By all the saints!" he exclaimed, "but I believe
the black was right. 'Tis the face of a gentle, or I
know naught of the breed, though the attire might fool
the very elect. Yet, <i>parbleu!</i> if memory serves, 'tis
scarcely worse than what I wore in Spain."</p>

<p>He swung down upon his feet and faced me, extending
one hand with all cordiality, while lips and
eyes smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said, bowing low, and with a
grace of movement quite new to me, "I bid you
hearty welcome to whatsoever of good cheer this
desert may have to offer, and present to you the
companionship of Villiers de Croix. It may not seem
much, yet I pledge you that kings have valued it ere
now."</p>

<p>It was a form of introduction most unfamiliar
to me, and seemed bristling with audacity and conceit;
but I recognized the heartiness of his purpose, and
hastened to make fit response.</p>

<p>"I meet you with much pleasure," I answered,
accepting the proffered hand. "I am John Wayland."</p>

<p>The graceful recklessness of the fellow, so conspicuous
in each word and action, strongly attracted
me. I confess I liked him from his first utterance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span>
although mentally, and perhaps morally as well, no
two men of our age could possibly be more unlike.</p>

<p>"Wayland?" he mused, with a shrug, as if the
sound of the word was unpleasant. "Wayland?&mdash;'tis
a harsh name to my ears, yet I have heard it mentioned
before in England as that of a great family.
You are English, then?"</p>

<p>I shook my head emphatically; for the old wounds
of controversy and battle were then being opened
afresh, and the feeling of antagonism ran especially
high along the border.</p>

<p>"I am of this country," I protested with earnestness,
"and we call ourselves Americans."</p>

<p>He laughed easily, evidently no little amused at
my retort, twisting his small mustache through his
slender fingers as he eyed me.</p>

<p>"Ah! but that is all one to me; it is ever the
blood and not the name that counts, my friend. Now
I am French by many a generation, Gascon by birth,
and bearing commission in the Guard of the Emperor;
yet sooth, 'tis the single accursed drop of Irish blood
within my veins that brings me across the great seas
and maroons me in this howling wilderness. But sit
down, Monsieur. There will be both food and wine
served presently, and I would speak with you more at
ease."</p>

<p>As he spoke he flung himself upon a low settee,
carelessly motioning me toward another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30 </a></span></p>

<p>"On my word," he said, eying me closely as I
crossed over to the bench, "but you are a big fellow
for your years, and 'tis strength, not flabby flesh, or
I know not how to judge. You would make a fine
figure of a soldier, John Wayland. Napoleon perchance
might offer you a marshal's baton, just to see
you in the uniform. <i>Parbleu!</i> I have seen stranger
things happen."</p>

<p>"You are now connected with the French army?"
I questioned, wondering what could have brought him
to this remote spot.</p>

<p>"Ay, a Captain of the Guard, yet an exile, banished
from the court on account of my sins. <i>Sacre!</i>
but there are others, Monsieur. I have but one fault,
my friend,&mdash;grave enough, I admit, yet but one, upon
my honor, and even that is largely caused by that
drop of Irish blood. I love the ladies over-well, I
sometimes fear; and once I dared to look too high
for favor."</p>

<p>"And have you stopped here long?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;at Hawkins's, mean you? Ten days, as
I live; would you believe I could ever have survived
so grievous a siege?" and he looked appealingly about
upon the bare apartment. "Ten days of Hawkins
and of Sam, Monsieur; ay! and of Ol' Burns; of sky,
and woods, and river, with never so much as a real
white man even to drink liquor with. By Saint
Louis! but I shall be happy enough to face you across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span>
the board to-night. Yet surely it is not your purpose
to halt here long?"</p>

<p>"Only until I succeed in joining some party travelling
westward to the Illinois country."</p>

<p>"No! is that your aim? 'Tis my trip also, if Fate
be ever kind enough to bring hither a guide. <i>Sacre!</i>
there was one here but now, as odd a devil as ever bore
rifle, and he hath taken the western trail alone, for he
hated me from the start. That was Ol' Burns. Know
you him?"</p>

<p>"'Twas he who brought the message that sent
me here; yet he said little of his own journey. But
you mention not where you are bound?"</p>

<p>"I seek Fort Dearborn, on the Great Lake."</p>

<p>"That likewise is to be the end of my journey.
You go to explore?"</p>

<p>"Explore? Faith, no," and he patted his hand
upon the bench most merrily. "There are but two
reasons to my mind important enough to lure a French
gentleman into such a hole as this, and send him
wandering through your backwoods,&mdash;either war or
love, Monsieur; and I know of no war that calleth
me."</p>

<p>Love, as he thus spoke of it, was almost an unknown
term to me then; and, in truth, I scarcely
grasped the full significance of his meaning.</p>

<p>"You seek some lady, then, at Fort Dearborn?"
I asked, for his tone seemed to invite the inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span></p>

<p>"Ay!" with quickened enthusiasm; "'tis there
Toinette has hidden herself for this year or more,&mdash;Toinette,
on my word as a French soldier, the fairest
maid of Montreal. I have just discovered her whereabouts,
yet I shall win her ere I traverse these trails
again, or I am not Villiers de Croix."</p>

<p>"I travel thither to bring back a little orphan
child with me," I explained simply, in response to his
look, "and will most gladly aid you where I can."</p>

<p>Before he could answer, Hawkins, a gaunt, silent
frontiersman, together with Sam, entered the room,
bearing between them our evening meal.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">W</span>E tarried at the table a
considerable time,&mdash;not because of any tempting variety
in the repast, as the
food furnished was of the
coarsest, but for the sake
of companionship, and because we discovered much
of passing interest to converse
about. De Croix had travelled widely, and
had seen a great variety of life both in camp and
court. He proved a vivacious fellow, full of amusing
anecdote,&mdash;a bottle of rich wine drawn from
his own private stock so stimulating his imagination
that I had little to do but sit and listen. Yet
he contrived to learn from me,&mdash;how, I hardly
know, the simple story of my life, and, indeed,
assumed a certain air of patronizing superiority,
boasting unduly of his wider experience and achievements
in a way that somewhat nettled me at last, as
I began to comprehend that he was merely showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
off his genteel graces the better to exhibit his
contempt for my provincial narrowness. I did not
permit this really to anger me, for our views upon
such matters were totally different, and I could not
help feel admiration for the brilliant and audacious
fellow.</p>

<p>The black waited upon us while we ate and drank,
moving noiselessly across the rough floor, so keenly
observant of his master's slightest wish as to convince
me the latter possessed a temper which upon occasion
burst its bounds. Yet now he was surely in the best of
humors; and with the coming of our second bottle,
after the remains of the repast had been removed, he
sang several love-songs in his native tongue, the meaning
of which I could only guess at.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise!" he exclaimed at last, flinging one
booted foot over the table corner. "You are a very
sphinx of a fellow. You deny being English, yet you
have all the silence of that nation. I am hungry, Monsieur,
for the sweet sound of the French tongue."</p>

<p>"'Tis a language of which I know little," I answered,
striving to speak pleasantly, although his
manner was becoming less and less to my liking. "I
have met with your <i>coureurs de bois</i> in plenty, and
picked up sufficient of their common phrases to enable
me to converse on ordinary themes with them; yet
I confess I find it difficult to follow your speech."</p>

<p><i>"Canaille,"</i> he returned, in tone of undisguised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
contempt, "Canadian half-breeds, the very offscourings
of our people. <i>Sacre!</i> but you should know us
at home, Monsieur,&mdash;we are the conquerors of the
world!"</p>

<p>I wish I could picture to you how he said this.
Simple as it now reads, he made it vital with meaning.
The insolent boast was uttered with such a swagger
that my face instantly flushed, and he noted it.</p>

<p>"Is it not true, Monsieur?" he asked quickly, his
own blood heated by the wine. "I tell you, the whole
of Europe has trembled, and will again, at the nod of
our Napoleon. Why, even over here we had to come
with our legions to help you repel the red-coats. Saint
Guise! but it was the Frenchmen who made you a
nation."</p>

<p>"Ay! but only that they might revenge themselves
upon England," I retorted blindly, "and the
force sent merely hurried a result already inevitable;
yet we gave you a slight touch of our own quality in
'98 that stung a bit, I warrant."</p>

<p>"Bah! a ship or two. 'Twas well for you that
our army was so closely engaged elsewhere, or the
story would have a different ending."</p>

<p>We were both of us upon our feet by this time,
glaring at each other across the board, our faces hot
with the ill-restrained passion of youth. A word more
from either would surely have precipitated matters;
but before it could be spoken the door leading into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
hallway was hurriedly flung aside, and, without apology
for the intrusion, two men strode forward into
the glare of light.</p>

<p>"Serve supper here, Hawkins," commanded the
first, his back still turned toward us. "Anything you
may chance to have in the house,&mdash;only let there be
little delay."</p>

<p>He was a tall, dark-featured man, smoothly
shaven, as swarthy as an Indian, with stern dark eyes,
thick coarse hair, and an abrupt manner born of
long command. His companion, of lighter build and
younger face, was attired in a travel-stained uniform of
blue and buff; but he who was evidently the leader
was so completely wrapped within the folds of a riding-cloak
as to reveal nothing of rank other than his unmistakable
military presence and bearing. Turning
from the door, he swept a penetrating glance over us,
loosening the clasp of his cloak as he did so.</p>

<p>"I regret having thoughtlessly interrupted your
quarrel, gentlemen," he said brusquely, "but this appears
to be the sole excuse for a public-room in the
place. However, my services are at your command if
they be desired in any way."</p>

<p>De Croix laughed, perfectly at his ease in a
moment.</p>

<p>"'Tis scarce so serious," he explained lightly.
"A mere interchange of compliments over the respective
merits of our nations in war."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span></p>

<p>The stranger looked at him intently, and with
some manifest disapproval.</p>

<p>"And yours, no doubt, was France," he said
shortly.</p>

<p>De Croix bowed, his hand upon his heart.</p>

<p>"I have worn her uniform, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"I thought as much, and fear my sympathies may
be altogether with your antagonist in the controversy.
Yet what's the use of wasting life like that? Surely
there is fighting enough in this world of ours for such
young blades, without inventing cause for quarrel.
Come, sit down once more, and join with us in whatsoever
cheer our landlord may provide."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he flung aside his cloak, revealing
beneath merely the well-worn dress of a frontiersman,
with an army sword-belt buckled about the waist.</p>

<p>"Come, Walter," he called to his companion, who
remained standing, "there is to be no touch of ceremony
here to-night. Gentlemen, I am Captain Wells,
formerly of the army, now Indian agent at Fort
Wayne; and this is Sergeant Jordan."</p>

<p>The Frenchman bowed gracefully, and extended
a card across the table. The other glanced at it
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Ah! De Croix; pleased to meet you. Think I
heard some of our officers speak of seeing you a month
ago at Detroit,&mdash;McBain or Ramsey, I have forgotten
which."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span></p>

<p>"I recall a game of cards with a Lieutenant
Ramsey, a rather choleric Scotchman, with a magnificent
capacity for strong whiskey."</p>

<p>The Captain turned inquiringly toward me, and
I hastened to name myself.</p>

<p>"Wayland, did you say?" he asked, with deepened
interest. "'Tis not a common appellation, yet
I once knew a Major by that name in Wayne's
command."</p>

<p>"My father, sir," I asserted proudly.</p>

<p>With quick impulsiveness he extended his hand.</p>

<p>"As noble a soldier as I have ever known," he
exclaimed heartily. "I served with him in two campaigns.
But what are you two young fellows doing
here? for it would be hard to conceive of a more
disheartening place of residence. Surely, De Croix,
you are not permanently located in this delightful
spot?"</p>

<p>"The saints forbid!" ejaculated the other, with
an expression of horror that caused the younger officer
to smile. "Yet I have already survived ten days of
it. We seek to join some party bound westward, either
to Fort Dearborn or beyond."</p>

<p>The elder officer smiled gravely, as his stern eyes
wandered thoughtfully over our faces in the candle-light.</p>

<p>"You will scarcely find those who go beyond,"
he said, at last, slowly. "That is our extreme frontier;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
and even this post, I hear it rumored, is to be abandoned
shortly. Indeed, I am now proceeding thither,
hoping to escort a niece safely eastward because of
that very probability. I can offer you naught save
companionship and guidance upon the journey; yet
if you needs must go, you may ride with us and welcome.
But 'tis my first duty to advise you strongly
against it."</p>

<p>"You look for trouble?" I asked, for his words
and manner were grave.</p>

<p>"I am not one easily alarmed," he answered, scanning
our faces as we fronted him; "but I have lived
long among the Indians, and know them well. This
new war with England will not pass without atrocities
along the border, and in my judgment we are now on
the eve of a general uprising of the savages. It will
surely come with the first news of British success, and
'tis the fear of reverses at Dearborn that has hurried
me westward. You, sir," and he turned toward me,
"are young, but it is evident you have been bred to
the frontier, so you will realize what it may mean to
us if we be caught in the Illinois country by such
an uprising."</p>

<p>I bowed, deeply impressed by his earnestness.</p>

<p>"I have, indeed, seen something of savage warfare,
and know much of its horror," I replied stoutly.
"Yet what you say of the possible future only makes
more urgent my duty to press on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span></p>

<p>"And you?" he asked De Croix.</p>

<p>"Faith, Captain," was the instant reply, "it is
the gentle hand of love which leads me westward,
and never yet did a true Frenchman hesitate in such
a quest because danger lurked between."</p>

<p>Wells smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Then my conscience is left clear," he exclaimed
heartily; "and if you ride with me to death, 'tis of
your own choosing. However, glad enough we have
cause to be thus to gain two more fighting men. I
have a party of Miamis travelling with me, and I
doubt not there will be ample work for all before we
return. Here comes supper; let us eat, drink, and be
merry, even though to-morrow it be our fate to die.
'Tis the best border philosophy."</p>

wine,&mdash;for that which De
Croix had furnished proved
excellent, and greatly stimulated our discourse. Yet,
I must confess, it was drunk
chiefly by the Frenchman
and Jordan; for Wells
barely touched his glass,
while I had never acquired a taste for such liquor. De
Croix waxed somewhat boastful, toward the last; but
we paid small heed to him, for I was deeply interested
in Captain Wells's earlier experiences among the savages,
which he related gravely and with much detail.
Jordan proved himself a reckless, roistering young
fellow, full of high spirits when in liquor; yet I formed
an impression that he stood well in his commander's
favor, for the latter warned him kindly to be more
abstemious.</p>

<p>However late it may have been when we finally
sought rest, we were early astir the next morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span>
I despatched Seth upon his return journey to the farm,
bearing under his girdle as cheerful a note of farewell
as I could frame; and then, though it was scarce later
than sun-up, the rest of us were fairly upon the westward
trail. There were in the party thirty Miami
Indians, strong, lusty-looking warriors, most of them.
The larger portion of them travelled in our advance,
under command of one of their chiefs; a smaller detachment
acting in similar manner as a rear-guard.
The white men, as well as the negro, who controlled
a pack animal heavily laden with his master's baggage,
were on horseback; and it pleased me greatly,&mdash;for
I was young and easily flattered,&mdash;to have Captain
Wells rein in his horse at my side as soon as we were
safely across the ford, leaving the Frenchman either
to companion with Jordan or ride alone.</p>

<p>I looked at De Croix curiously, as he moved forward
with slow carelessness in our front, for he had
kept the entire company waiting outside the house for
half an hour in the gray dawn while he curled and
powdered his hair. Doubtless this was what so disgusted
Wells, whose long black locks were worn in a
simple queue, tied somewhat negligently with a dark
cord. I almost smiled at the scowl upon his swarthy
face, as he contemplated the fashionably attired dandy,
whose bright-colored raiment was conspicuous against
the dark forest-leaves that walled us round.</p>

<p>"I have heard it claimed these gay French beaux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> 43 </a></span>
fight well when need arises," he commented at last,
thoughtfully; "but 'tis surely a poor place here for
flaunting ribbons and curling locks. Possibly my fine
gentleman yonder may have occasion to test his mettle
before we ride back again. Sure it is that if that time
ever comes he will not look so sweet."</p>

<p>"You make me feel that we go forward into real
peril," I said, wondering that he should seem so fearful
of the outcome, "Have you special reason?"</p>

<p>"The Miamis have already been approached by
Indian runners, and their young men are restless. It
was only because I am the adopted son of Big Turtle,
and a recognized warrior of their tribe, that these have
consented to accompany me; and I fear they may
desert at the first sign of a hostile meeting," he answered
gravely. "There is an Indian conspiracy forming,
and a most dangerous one, involving, so far as I
can learn, every tribe north of the Ohio. Now that
war with England has actually been declared, there
can no longer be doubt that the chiefs will take sides
with the British. They have everything to gain and
little to lose by such action. The rumor was at Fort
Wayne, even before we left, that Mackinac had already
fallen; and if that prove true, every post west of the
Alleghanies is in danger. I fear that death and flame
will sweep the whole frontier; and I frankly acknowledge,
Wayland, my only hope in this expedition is
that, by hard travel, we may be able to reach Chicagou

and return again before the outbreak comes. Tom
Burns, an old scout of Wayne's, and a settler in that
country, was at Fort Wayne a month since with an
urgent message from the commandant at Dearborn.
I tell you frankly, it will be touch and go with us."</p>

<p>"Chicagou?" I questioned, for the word was one
I had heard but once before and was of an odd sound.</p>

<p>"Ay! old Au Sable called it the Chicagou portage
long before the fort named Dearborn was ever established
there. 'Tis the name the French applied to a
small river entering the Great Lake from the west at
that point."</p>

<p>"Have you journeyed there before?"</p>

<p>"Once, in 1803. I held Indian council on the spot,
and helped lay out the government reservation. 'Tis
a strange flat country, with much broken land extending
to the northward."</p>

<p>Little by little our conversation lapsed into
silence; for the narrow trail we followed was a most
difficult one, and at times taxed our ingenuity to the
utmost. It led through dense dark woods, fortunately
free from underbrush, skirted the uncertain edges of
numerous marshes in the soft ooze of which the hoofs
of our horses sank dangerously, and for several miles
followed the sinuous course of a small but rapid
stream, the name of which I have forgotten. There
were few openings in the thick forest-growth, and the
matted branches overhead, interlaced with luxuriant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span>
wild vines, so completely shut out all vestige of the
sun that we toiled onward, hour after hour, in continuous twilight.</p>

<p>What mysterious signs our guides followed, I was
not sufficiently expert in woodcraft to determine. To
my eyes,&mdash;and I sought to observe with care,&mdash;there
was nowhere visible the slightest sign that others had
ever preceded us; it was all unbroken, virgin wilderness,
marked only by slow centuries of growth.
The accumulation of moss on the tree-trunks, as well
as the shading of the leaves, told me that we continued
to journey almost directly westward; and there
was no perceptible hesitancy in our steady progress,
save as we deviated from it here and there because
of natural obstacles too formidable to be directly
surmounted.</p>

<p>We skirted immense trees, veritable monarchs of
the ages, hoary with time, grim guardians of such
forest solitudes; climbed long hills roughened by innumerable
boulders with sharp edges hidden beneath
the fallen leaves, that lamed our horses; or descended
into dark and gloomy ravines, dank with decaying
vegetation, finally halting for a brief meal upon the
southern edge of a small lake, the water of which was
as clear and blue as the cloudless August sky that
arched it. The sand of the shore where we rested was
white as snow, yet De Croix had his man spread a
cloak upon it before he ventured to sit down, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
with care tucked a lace handkerchief about his throat
to prevent stray crumbs from soiling the delicate yellow
of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"One might fancy this was to be your wedding
day, Monsieur," observed Wells, sarcastically, as
he marked these dainty preparations, and noted with
disgust the attentive negro hovering near. "We
are not perfumed courtiers dancing at the court of
Versailles."</p>

<p>De Croix glanced about him carelessly.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, no," he said, tapping the lid of a
richly chased silver snuff-box with his slender fingers.
"Yet, my dear friend, a French gentleman cannot
wholly forget all that belongs to the refinements of
society, even in the heart of the wilderness. Sam, by
any foul chance did you overlook the lavender water?"</p>

<p>"No, sah; it am safe in de saddle-bags."</p>

<p>"And the powder-puff, the small hand-mirror,
and the curling-iron?"</p>

<p>"I saw to ebery one ob dem, sah."</p>

<p>De Croix gave a deep sigh of relief, and rested
back upon the cloak, negligently crossing his legs.</p>

<p>"Captain," he remarked slowly and thoughtfully,
"you've no idea the trouble that negro is to me.
Would you believe it? he actually left my nail-brush
behind at Detroit, and not another to be had for love
or money this side of Montreal! And only last night
he mislaid a box of rouge, and, by Saint Denis! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
hardly dare hope there is so much as an ounce of it
in the whole party."</p>

<p>"I rather suspect not," was the somewhat crusty
reply; "yet if a bit of bear's grease could be made
to serve your turn, we might possibly find some among
us."</p>

<p>"I know not its virtue," admitted the Frenchman
gravely; "yet if it reddens the lips it might be useful.
But that which I had came from the shop of Jessold in
Paris, and is beyond all price."</p>

<p>We were ten days upon this forest journey, from
the time of our crossing the Maumee; and they were
hard days, even to those of us long habituated to the
hardships of border travel. Indeed, I know few forms
of exertion that so thoroughly test the mettle of men
as journeying across the wilderness. There are no
artificial surroundings, either to inspire or restrain;
and insensibly humanity returns to natural conditions,
permitting the underlying savage to gain ascendency.
I have seen more than one seemingly polished gentleman,
resplendent with all the graces of the social code,
degenerate into a surly brute with only a few hours
of such isolation and the ceaseless irritation of the
trail. Yet I must acknowledge that De Croix accepted
it all without a murmur, and as became a man. His
entire plaint was over the luxuries he must forego,
and he made far more ado about a bit of dust soiling
his white linen than about any real hardship of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
march. 'Tis my memory that he rather grew upon
us; for his natural spirits were so high that he sang
where others swore, and found cause for amusement
and laughter in much that tested sorely even the
Indian-like patience of Wells. He was like a boy,
this gayly perfumed dandy of the French court; but
beneath his laces and ribbons, his affectations and
conceits, there hid a stout heart that bade him smile
where other men would lie down and die. He companioned
mostly with Jordan as we journeyed, for
Wells never could become reconciled to his mincing
ways; yet I confess now that I began to value him
greatly, and longed more than once to join with the
two who rode in our advance, cheering their wearisome
way with quips of fancy and snatches of song.
He knew it too, the tantalizing rascal, and would frequently
send back a biting squib over his shoulder,
hoping thus to draw me away from the silent grim-faced
soldier beside whom I held place.</p>

<p>It was truly a rough and wild journey, full enough
of hardship, and without adventure to give zest to the
ceaseless toil. I know now that we made a wide
detour to the southward, trusting thus to avoid any
possible contact with prowling bands of either Pottawattomies
or Wyandots, whom our friendly Miamis
seemed greatly to dread. This took us far from the
regular trail, rough and ill-defined as that was, and
plunged us into an untrodden wilderness; so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span>
there were times when we fairly had to cut our way
through the twisted forest branches and tangled
brakes of cane with tomahawks and hunting-knives.
We skirted rocky bluffs, toiled painfully over fallen
timber, or waded ankle deep in softened clay, in the
black gloomy shadows of dense woods which seemed
interminable, meeting with nothing human, yet constantly
startling wild game from the hidden coverts,
and feeling more and more, as we advanced, the loneliness
and danger of our situation,&mdash;realizing that
each league we travelled only added to the length and
peril of our retreat if ever disaster came or Fort Dearborn
were found deserted.</p>

<p>Captain Wells, naturally grave and silent from his
long training among savages, grew more and more
reticent and watchful as we progressed, riding often
at my side for hours without uttering a word, his
keen eyes warily searching the dark openings upon
every hand as if suspecting that each spot of gloom
might prove the chosen place for an ambuscade. Our
Indian allies moved like shadows, gliding over the
ground noiselessly; and the occasional outbursts of
merriment from De Croix and his equally reckless
companion grew gradually less frequent, and appeared
more forced. The constant and never-ending toil
of our progress, the depressing gloom of the sombre
primeval forest on every side of us, the knowledge of
possible peril lurking in each league of this haunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span>
silence, weighed upon us all, and at last closed the
lips of even the most jovial of our number.</p>

<p>It was the tenth day, as I remember,&mdash;though it
may have been later, for I have no writing to guide
me concerning dates,&mdash;when we emerged into a
broad valley, treeless save for a thin fringe of dwarfed
growth skirting the bank of a shallow stream which
ran almost directly westward. I cannot describe how
sweet, after our gloomy journey, the sunlight appeared,
as we first marked it play in golden waves
over the long grass; or the relief we felt at being able
to gaze ahead once more and see something of the
country that we were traversing. 'Twas like a sudden
release from prison. Our jaded horses felt with
us the exhilaration of the change, and moved with
greater sprightliness than they had shown for days.
As the sun began its circle downward, vast rolling
hills of white and yellow sand arose upon the right
of our line of march, huge mounds, many of them,
glistening in the sunshine, some jagged at the summit,
others rounded as if by art, so unusual in form and
presence that I ventured to address our leader regarding
them, as he rode with his head bent low and a far-off
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"The sand?" he questioned, glancing up as if
startled at the sound of my voice. "Why, it has been
cast there by the stormy waves of the Great Lake, my
lad, and beaten into those strange and fantastic shapes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> 51 </a></span>
by the action of the wind. Doubtless 'tis the work
of centuries of storms."</p>

<p>"Are we, then, so close to the lake?" I asked
eagerly,&mdash;for I had never yet seen so large a body
of water, and his description fired my imagination.</p>

<p>"'Tis but just beyond those dunes yonder, and
will be still nearer when we come to camp. Possibly
you might reach the shore before dark if you exercise
care,&mdash;for there is danger of becoming lost in that
sand desert. Those hills seem all alike when once
you are among them."</p>

<p>"What is it that so greatly disturbs your Miamis?"
I ventured to ask, for I had been noticing for some
time that they were restless and travelling poorly.
"They have been counselling now for two hours."</p>

<p>He glanced aside at me in apparent surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, boy, I thought you were bred to the border;
and can you ask me such a question? Do you
observe nothing, like that fine gentleman yonder?
What have we been following since first we entered
this valley?"</p>

<p>"An old Indian trail."</p>

<p>"True," he exclaimed, "and one that has been
traversed by a large war-party, bound west, within
twelve hours."</p>

<p>"How know you this?"</p>

<p>"By a hundred signs far plainer than print will
ever be to my eyes. In faith, I thought those fellows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
out yonder would have summoned me to council long
ere this, instead of threshing it out among themselves.
They are bolder warriors than I deemed, though they
will doubtless revolt in earnest when we camp. We
shall have to guard them well to-night."</p>

<p>As he paused, his eyes fixed anxiously upon our
Indian allies, De Croix began to hum a popular tune
of the day, riding meanwhile, hat in hand, with one
foot out of the stirrup to beat the time. Then Jordan
caught up the refrain, and sang a verse. I saw one or
two of the older Indians glance around at him in grave
displeasure.</p>

<p>"The young fools!" muttered Wells, uneasily.
"I shall enjoy seeing if that French popinjay keeps all
of his fine airs when the hour for stern work comes."</p>

<p>He lifted his voice.</p>

<p>"Jordan!"</p>

<p>The young soldier instantly ceased his song, and
turned in his saddle to glance back.</p>

<p>"The time has come when I must insist on less
noise, and more decorum upon the march," Wells said
sternly. "This is not Fort Wayne, nor is our road
devoid of danger. Captain de Croix, I shall have to request
you also to cease your singing for the present."</p>

<p>There was that in his voice and manner which
forbade remark, and we rode on silently. I asked:</p>

<p>"But you have not explained to me how you
learned all this of which you spoke?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span></p>

<p>"By the use of my eyes, of course. It is all
simple; there are marks beside the beaten trail, as
well as in its track, which prove clearly the party
ahead of us to be moving westward, that it travelled
rapidly, and was certainly not less than a hundred
strong, with ponies and lodge-poles. Not more than
a league back we passed the evidences of a camp that
had not been deserted longer than twelve hours; and
when we crossed the river, a feather from a war-bonnet
was lying in the grass. These are small details, yet
they tell the story. That feather, for instance, was
dropped from a Pottawattomie head-dress, and no
doubt there are warriors among those Indians yonder
who could name the chief who wore it. It simply
means, my lad, that the savages are gathering in
toward Dearborn, and we may reach there all too
late."</p>

<p>"Is the way yet long?" and my eyes sought the
horizon, where the sun hung like a red ball of fire.</p>

<p>"We should be there by the morrow," he answered,
"for we are now rounding the head of the
Great Lake. I wish to God I might see what fate
awaits us there."</p>

<p>Young and thoughtless as I was in those days, I
could not fail to realize the depth of feeling which
swayed this stern, experienced man; and I rode on
beside him, questioning no more.</p>

</span>&nbsp;THINK it must be in the
blood of all of New England birth to love the sea.
They may never have seen
it, nor even heard its wild,
stern music; yet the fascination of great waters is
part of their heritage. The
thought of that vast inland
ocean, of the magnitude and sublimity of which I had
only the vaguest conception, haunted me all that afternoon;
and I scarcely removed my eyes from those
oddly constructed mounds of drifted sand, striving
vainly to gain, through some depression between them,
a fleeting glimpse of the restless waters that had helped
to shape them into such fantastic forms.</p>

<p>As the sun sank, angry red in our faces, presaging
a storm, the course of the little stream we had been
following drew in closer toward these grotesque piles,
and the trail we followed became narrower, with the
sluggish current pressing upon one side and that odd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> 55 </a></span>
bank of gleaming sand upon the other. In a little open
space, where quite a carpet of coarse yellowish grass
had found lodgment, beneath the protecting shadow of
a knot of cottonwoods, we finally made camp, and proceeded
to prepare our evening meal. Determined to
strike north through those guarding sand-dunes, and
reach the shore of the lake if possible before final
darkness fell, I hastily crowded my pockets with food,
and looked eagerly around for some congenial companion.
Captain Wells, whom I should have preferred
to be with me, was deep in conference with one of the
Miami chiefs, and not to be disturbed; Jordan had
seemingly been detailed to the command of the night-guard;
so, as a last resort, I turned aside and sought
De Croix. I found him seated cross-legged on a
blanket beneath one of the cottonwoods, a silver-backed
mirror propped against a tree-butt in his front,
while the obsequious darkey was deliberately combing
out his long hair and fashioning it anew. The Frenchman
glanced up at me with a welcoming smile of rare
good-humor.</p>

<p>"Ah, sober-face! and have you at last mustered
courage to break away from the commander of this
most notable company?" he cried mockingly. "'Tis
passing strange he does not chain you to his saddle!
By Saint Guise! 'twould indeed be the only way in
which so dull a cavalier would ever hold me loyal to
his whims. Friend Wayland, I scarce thought you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
would ever thus honor me again; and yet, 'tis
true, I have had an ambition within my heart ever
since we first met. 'Tis to cause you to fling aside
those rough habiliments of the wilderness, and attire
yourself in garments more becoming civilized man.
Would that I might induce you, even now, to permit
Sam to rearrange those heavy blond locks <i> la
Pompadour</i>. Bless me! but it would make a new man
of you."</p>

<p>"Such is not at all my desire, Monsieur," I answered,
civilly. "I came now merely to learn if you
would walk with me through these dunes of sand
before the daylight fades."</p>

<p>He looked out, idly enough, across that dreary
expanse of desolation, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Use the other powder, Sam, the lighter colored,"
he murmured languidly, as if the sight had wearied
him; "and mind you drop not so much as a pinch
upon the waistcoat."</p>

<p>Then he lifted his eyes inquiringly to mine.</p>

<p>"For what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To look forth upon the Great Lake. Captain
Wells tells me 'tis but a brief and safe walk from
here to the shore-line."</p>

<p>"The lake?&mdash;water?" and the expression upon
his face made me smile. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, man! have you
become crazed by the hard march? What have
I ever said in our brief intercourse that could cause
you to conceive I care greatly for that? If it were
only wine, now!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span></p>

<p>"You have no desire to go with me, then?"</p>

<p>"Lay out the red tie, Sam; no, the one with the
white spots in it, and the small curling-iron. No,
Monsieur; what you ask is impossible. I travel to
the west for higher purpose than to gaze upon a
heaving waste of water. <i>Sacre!</i> did I not have a full
hundred days of such pleasure when first I left France?
My poor stomach has not fairly settled yet from its
fierce churning. Know ye not, Master Wayland, that
we hope to be at this Fort Dearborn upon the morrow,
and 'tis there I meet again the fair Toinette? Saints!
but I must look my best at such a time, not worn and
haggard from tramping through the sand. She was
ever a most critical maid in such matters, and has not
likely changed. 'Tis curled too high upon the right
brow, you black imp! and, as I live, there is one hair
you have missed entirely."</p>

<p>Realizing the uselessness of waiting longer, I
turned my back upon his vanity, and strode off alone.
It is not my nature to swerve from a purpose merely
because others differ in desires; and I was now determined
to carry out my plan. I took one of the narrow
depressions between two mounds of sand and plunged
resolutely forward, endeavoring to shape my course
as directly northward as the peculiarities of the path
would admit. To my mind, there was little to fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"> 58 </a></span>
from the hostile Indians, as every sign proved them
to be hastening westward in advance of us; while I
was too long accustomed to adventure to be easily
confused, even in the midst of that lonely desolation.</p>

<p>I soon found the walking difficult; for I sank to
the ankles with each step, while the soft sliding sand
rolled beneath me so as to yield no solid foothold.
The irregularity of the mounds continually blocked
my passage, and caused me to deviate in direction, so
that I grew somewhat bewildered, the entire surface
bearing such uniformity of outline as to afford little
guide. Yet I held to my original course fairly well,
for I could pilot somewhat by the dim north star; and
it was not long before my alert ears caught the pounding
of surf along the shore-line. Much encouraged,
I pressed forward with greater rapidity, ignoring the
lanes between the dunes, and clambering over the
mounds themselves in my eagerness to reach the lake
before the complete closing down of night.</p>

<p>At last I topped a particularly high ridge that
felt solid to the feet; and as I did so the wind came,
hard and biting, against my face. There, just below
me, not fifty feet away, were rolling the great waves,
white-capped and roaring, pounding like vast sledges
upon the anvil of the sand. My entire being thrilled
at the majestic sight, and for the moment I forgot
everything as I gazed away across those restless,
heaving waters, seemingly without limit, stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> 59 </a></span>
forth into the dim northward as far as the eye could
reach, until water and sky imperceptibly met and
blended. Each advancing wave, racing toward the
beach, was a white-lipped messenger of mystery; and
the vast tumultuous sea, rolling in toward me out of
that dark unknown, with its deep voice of thunder and
high-bursting spray, breathed the sublimest lessons
of the Infinite to my soul. It awed, impressed, silenced
with the sense of its solemn power. No dream
of ocean grandeur had ever approached the reality now
outspread before me, as this vast inland sea tossed and
quivered to the lashing of the storm-wind that swept
its surface into fury.</p>

<p>To the left and right of where I stood motionless,
curved the shore-line, a seemingly endless succession
of white shining sand-hills, with the sloping shingle up
which the huge breakers tossed and rolled in continuous
thunder and foam, rising, breaking, receding, chasing
each other in gigantic play. How savagely strong it
all looked! what uncontrollable majesty lived in every
line of the scene! The very suggestion of tremendous
power in it was, to my imagination, immeasurably
increased by its unutterable loneliness, its seemingly
total absence of life; for not a fin rose above the surface,
not a wing brushed the air overhead. The sun,
sinking slowly behind the rim of sand, shot one
golden-red ray far out into that tumbling waste, forming
a slender bridge of ever-changing light that seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
to rest suspended upon the breaking crests of the
waves it spanned. Then, gradually, stealthily, silently,
the denser curtain of the twilight drew closer and
closer, and my vista narrowed, as the shadows swept
toward me like black-robed ghosts.</p>

<p>I turned about reluctantly, to retrace my steps
while the dim light yet lingered. Some unseen angel of
mercy it must have been that bade me pause, and led
me gently down the steep bank to the water's edge,
where the sharp spray lashed my cheeks. If this be
not the cause, then I know not why I went; or why,
once being there, I should have turned to the right,
and rounded the edge of the little bay. Yet all of this
I did; and God knows that many a time since I have
thanked Him for it upon my knees.</p>

<p>I saw first the thing bobbing up and down behind
a bare wave-washed rock that lifted a hoary crown
close beside the water's edge. A branch from off
some tree, I thought, until I had taken a half-dozen
curious steps nearer, and felt my heart bound as I
knew it to be a boat. My first thought, of course, was
of hostile Indians; and I swept the sand-hills anxiously
for any other sign of human presence. The
world about me was soundless except for the ceaseless
roaring of the waves, and there was not even a leaf
within my sight to flutter. I crept forward cautiously,
seeing no footprints on the smooth sand, until my
searching eyes rested upon a white hand, dangling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
as if lifeless, over the boat's gunwale. Forgetting
everything else in the excitement of this discovery, I
sprang hastily forward and peered within the boat.</p>

<p>It was an awkward and rudely-formed water-craft,
with neither mast nor oars, yet of fair size, broad-beamed
and seaworthy. In the forward part lay the
body of a woman; curled up and resting upon the
boat's bottom, the head buried upon the broad seat
so that no face was visible, with one hand hidden
beneath, the other outstretched above the rail. So
huddled was her posture that I could distinguish few
details in the fading light; yet I noted that she wore
a white upper garment, and that her thick hair flowed
in a dense black mass about her shoulders.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood there helpless, believing I
gazed upon death. She either moved slightly, or the
waves rocked the boat so as to somewhat disturb her
posture. That semblance of life sent my blood leaping
once more within my veins, and I leaned over and
touched her cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, go away! Please go away!" she cried, not
loudly, but with a stress of utterance that caused me
to start back half in terror. "I am not afraid of you,
but either take my soul or go away and leave me."</p>

<p>"For whom do you mistake me?" I asked, my
hand closing now over hers.</p>

<p>"For another devil come out of the black night
to torture me afresh!" she answered, never once moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> 62 </a></span>
even to my touch. "Ah, what legions there must
be to send forth so many after the soul of one poor
girl! 'Tis not that I shrink from the end. Death!
why, have I not died a hundred deaths already? Yet
do I trust the Christ and Mother Mary. But why does
the angel of their mercy hold back from me so long?"</p>

<p>Was she crazed, driven mad by some extremity
of suffering at which I could only guess? That oarless
boat, beached amid the desolation of sand and the
waste of water, alone told a story to make the heart
sick. I hesitated, not knowing what I had best say.
She lifted her head slowly, and gazed at me. I caught
one glimpse of a pale young face framed in masses of
black dishevelled hair, and saw large dark eyes that
seemed to glow with a strange fire.</p>

<p>"You,&mdash;you cannot be a devil also," she said,
stammeringly. "You do not look like those others,&mdash;are
you a man?"</p>

<p>I bowed in silence, astounded by her words and
appearance.</p>

<p>"Yet you are not of the garrison,&mdash;not of Dearborn.
I have never seen your face before. Yet you
are surely a man, and white. Holy Mother! can it
indeed be that you have come to save me?"</p>

<p>"I am here to serve you by every means in my
power," I answered soberly, for the wildness of her
speech almost frightened me. "God, I truly think,
must have led me to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> 63 </a></span></p>

<p>Her wonderful eyes, questioning, anxious, doubtful,
never once left my face.</p>

<p>"Who are you? How came you here?"</p>

<p>"I am named John Wayland," I replied, striving
to speak as simply as might be, so that she would
comprehend, "and form one of a small party travelling
overland from the east toward the Fort. We are encamped
yonder at the edge of the sand. I left the
camp an hour ago, and wandered hither that I might
look out upon the waters of the Great Lake; and here,
through the strange providence of God, I have found
you."</p>

<p>She glanced apprehensively backward over her
shoulder across the darkened waters, and her slight
form shook.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, take me away from it!" she cried, a
note of undisguised terror in her voice, and her hands
held out toward me in a pitiful gesture of appeal.
"Oh, that horrible, cruel water! I have loved it in
the past, but now I hate it; how horribly it has tortured
me! Take me away, I beg,&mdash;anywhere, so that
I can neither see nor hear it any more. It has neither
heart nor soul." And she hid her face behind the
streaming hair.</p>

<p>"You will trust me, then?" I asked, for I had
little knowledge of women. "You will go with me?"</p>

<p>She flung the clinging locks back from her eyes,
with an odd, imperious gesture which I thought most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span>
becoming, holding them in place with one hand, while
extending the other frankly toward me.</p>

<p>"Go with you? Yes," she replied, unhesitatingly.
"I have known many men such as you are, men of
the border, and have always felt free to trust them;
they are far more true to helpless womanhood than
many a perfumed cavalier. You have a face that
speaks of honor and manliness. Yes, I will go with
you gladly."</p>

<p>I was deeply impressed by her sudden calmness,
her rapid repression of that strange wildness of demeanor
that had at first so marked her words and
manner. As I partially lifted her from the boat to
the sand, she staggered heavily, and would have fallen
had I not instantly caught her to me. For a single
moment her dark eyes looked up confidingly into
mine, as she rested panting against my shoulder, and
I could feel her slender form tremble within my
arms.</p>

<p>"You are ill&mdash;faint?" I questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>She drew back from me with all gentleness, and
did not venture again to attempt standing entirely
without support.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed so to exhibit my weakness," she
murmured. "I fear I am greatly in need of food.
What day is this?"</p>

<p>"The twelfth of August."</p>

<p>"And it was the night of the tenth when I drifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>
out of the mouth of the river. Ever since then I have
been drifting, the sport of the winds and waves."</p>

<p>"Sit you down here, then," I commanded, now
fully awakened to her immediate need. "The sand
is yet warm from the sun, and I have food with me in
my pockets."</p>

<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page66_i.png" width="166" height="170" alt="I" />
</span>&nbsp;HAVE since thought it almost providential that my
food supply was so limited;
for, after first asking me if
I had eaten all I required,
she fell upon it like a famished thing, and did not
desist until all was gone. A
threatening bank of dark
cloud was creeping slowly up the northern sky as we
were resting, but directly overhead the stars were shining
brilliantly, yielding me sufficient light for the study
of her face. She was certainly less than my own age
by two or three years, a girl barely rounding into the
slender beauty of her earliest womanhood, with hints
of both in face and form. She was simply dressed, as,
indeed, might naturally be expected in a wilderness
far removed from marts of trade; but her clothing
was of excellent texture, and became her well in spite
of its recent exposure, while a bit of rather expensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
lace at the throat and a flutter of gay ribbons about
the wrists told plainly that she did not disdain the
usual adornments of her sex. And this was quickly
shown in another way. She had not yet completed
her frugal meal when her mind reverted to her personal
appearance, and she paused, with heightened
color, to draw back her loosened hair and fasten it in
place with a knot of scarlet cord. It was surely a
winsome face that smiled up at me then.</p>

<p>"I feel almost guilty of robbery," she said, "in
taking all this food, which was no doubt intended for
your own supper."</p>

<p>"Merely what chanced to be left of it," I answered
heartily. "Had I so much as dreamed this
stretch of sand was to yield me such companionship,
I should have stinted myself more."</p>

<p>An expression of bewildered surprise crept into
her eyes as I spoke.</p>

<p>"Surely you are not a mere <i>coureur de bois</i>, as I
supposed from your dress," she exclaimed. "Your
expression is that of an educated gentleman."</p>

<p>I smiled; for I was young enough to feel the
force of her unconscious flattery.</p>

<p>"I believe I can prove descent from an old and
honorable race," I said; "but it has been my fortune
to be reared in the backwoods, and whatever education
has come to me I owe to the love and skill of
my mother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span></p>

<p>My frankness pleased her, and she made no attempt
to disguise her interest.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you told me," she said simply.
"My mother died when I was only ten, yet her
memory has always been an inspiration. Are you a
Protestant?"</p>

<p>This unexpected question took me by surprise;
yet I answered unhesitatingly, "Yes."</p>

<p>"I was educated at the Ursuline Convent in Montreal.
It was my mother's dearest wish that I should
take the vows of that order, but I fear I am far too
frivolous for so serious a life. I love happy things too
well, and the beautiful outside world of men and
women. I ran away from the Sisters, and then my
father and I voyaged to this country, where we might
lead a freer life together."</p>

<p>"Here?" and I glanced questioningly about me
into those darkening shadows which were momentarily
hemming us in more closely.</p>

<p>"To Fort Dearborn," she explained. "We came
by boat through the straits at the north; and 'twas
a trip to remember. My father brought out goods
from Canada, and traded with the Indians. I have
been in their villages. Once I was a week alone with
a tribe of Sacs near Green Bay, and they called me the
White Queen. I have met many famous warriors of
the Wyandots and Pottawattomies, and have seen
them dance at their council. Once I journeyed as far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"> 69 </a></span>
west as the Great River, across leagues and leagues
of prairie," and her face lighted up at the remembrance.
"Father said he thought I must be the first
white woman who had ever travelled so far inland.
We have been at Dearborn for nearly a year."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and swept her eyes, with
some anxiety, around upon dim mounds of sand that
appeared more fantastic than ever in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Had we not better be going?" she asked.
"There is surely a storm gathering yonder."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, for I had not been indifferent
to the clouds steadily banking up in the north. "Yet
you have not told me your name, and I should be most
glad to know it."</p>

<p>The girl courtesied mockingly, as though half
inclined to laugh at my insistence.</p>

<p>"What is a name?" she exclaimed. "'Tis not
that for which we greatly care. Now I&mdash;I am simply
Mademoiselle Antoinette,&mdash;at least, so most of those
I care for call me; and from now on, the very good
friend of Master John Wayland."</p>

<p>I was deeply conscious that I blushed at her
words and manner; but with it there arose an instant
query in my mind: could this be the fair Toinette
whom De Croix sought so ardently? I greatly feared
it; yet I resolved I would not mention his name to
her.</p>

<p>"It has a decided French sound," I stammered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> 70 </a></span></p>

<p>She laughed at my tone, with a quick shrug of
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"And pray, why not, Monsieur? Have you such
a prejudice against that great people that you need
speak of them with so glum a voice? Ah, but if I
must, then I shall endeavor to teach you a higher
regard for us."</p>

<p>"That may not prove so hard a task," I hastened
to assure her; "though I was surprised,&mdash;you speak
English with so pure an accent that I had not dreamed
you other than of my own race."</p>

<p>"My father was of English blood," she answered
more gravely; "but I fear you will find me quite of
my mother's people, if ever we come to know each
other well. But hark! that was surely thunder!
We have loitered too long; the storm is about to
break."</p>

<p>It was indeed upon us almost before she ceased
speaking. A sudden rush of wind sent my hat flying
into the darkness, and whipped her long black
hair loose from its restraining knot. I had barely
time to wrap my hunting-jacket closely around her
shoulders, when the rain came dashing against our
faces.</p>

<p>I drew her unresistingly around the edge of the
nearest sand-pile; but this supplied poor protection
against the storm, the wind lashing the fine grit into
our faces, stinging us like bits of fire. I tried to excavate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> 71 </a></span>
some sort of cave that might afford us at least
a partial shelter; but the sand slid down almost as
rapidly as I could dig it out with my hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us press on!" she urged, laying her
hand upon my arm in entreaty. "We shall become
no wetter moving, and your camp, you said, was only
a short distance away."</p>

<p>"But are you strong enough to walk?" And as
I leaned forward toward her, a quick flash of vivid
lightning, directly overhead, lit both our faces. I
marked she did not shrink, and no look of fear came
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am quite myself once more," she answered
confidently. "It was despair and loneliness that so
disheartened me. I have never been timid physically,
and your presence has brought back the courage I
needed."</p>

<p>There was a natural frankness, a peculiar confidence,
about this girl, that robbed me of my usual
diffidence; and as we struggled forward through the
dampening sand, her dress clinging about her and
retarding progress, I dared to slip one arm about her
waist to help in bearing her along. She accepted this
timely aid in the spirit with which it was offered,
without so much as a word of protest; and the wind,
battering at our backs, pushed us forward.</p>

<p>"Oh, that troublesome hair!" she exclaimed, as
the long tresses whipped in front of our faces, blinding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> 72 </a></span>
us both. "I have never before felt so much like sacrificing it."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will not consider such an act
now," I protested, aiding her to reclaim the truants,
"for as I saw it before the darkness fell, your hair
was surely worthy of preservation."</p>

<p>"You laugh at me; I know I must have been a
far from pretty sight."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to say with frankness what I
thought of your appearance under such disadvantages?"</p>

<p>She glanced at me almost archly, in the flash of
lightning that rent the sky.</p>

<p>"I am really afraid to answer yes,&mdash;yet perhaps
I am brave enough to venture it."</p>

<p>"I have never been at court, Mademoiselle, and
so you may not consider my judgment in such matters
of much moment; but I thought you rarely
beautiful."</p>

<p>For a moment she did not attempt to speak, but I
could distinctly feel the heaving of her bosom as I
held her hard against the assault of the wind, and
bent low hoping to catch an answer.</p>

<p>"You are sincere and honest," she said at last,
slowly, and I felt that the faint trace of mockery had
utterly vanished from her soft voice. "'Tis manifest
in your face and words. You speak not lightly, nor
with mere empty compliment, as would some gilded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"> 73 </a></span>
courtiers I have known; and for that reason I do
value your opinion."</p>

<p>"You are not angry at my presumption?"</p>

<p>"Angry?&mdash;I?" and she stopped and faced me,
holding back her hair as she did so. "I am a woman,
Monsieur; and all women, even those of us hidden
here in the wilderness, like best those who admire
them. I do not know that I am as beautiful as you
say, yet other men have often said the same without
being pressed for their opinion. No, I am not angry,&mdash;I
am even glad to know you think so."</p>

<p>"And you surely do know?" I insisted, with a
courage strange to me.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, but her eyes fell before
my eagerness; "you are not one who has yet learned
to lie, even to women. 'Tis a relief to know there are
such men still in the world."</p>

<p>We had come to a full halt by this time.</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea where we may be?" she
asked, peering anxiously about, and perhaps glad to
change the tone of our conversation. "I cannot note a
landmark of any kind. These sand-hills seem all alike."</p>

<p>"I believe we have kept to the southward, for
we have merely drifted with the storm; but I confess
my sole guidance has been the direction of the wind,
as these sand-lanes are most confusing. If there were
the slightest shelter at hand, I should insist upon your
waiting until the rain was over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> 74 </a></span></p>

<p>"No, it is better to go on. I am now wet to the
skin, and shall be warmer moving than resting on this
damp sand."</p>

<p>We must have been moving for an hour, scarcely
speaking a word, for the severe exertion required all
our breath. The rain had ceased, and stars began
to glimmer amid the cloud-rifts overhead; but I knew
now that we were lost. She stopped suddenly, and
sank down upon the sand.</p>

<p>"I am exhausted," she admitted, "and believe
we are merely moving about in a circle."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, reluctantly; "we are wasting our
strength to no purpose. 'T will be better to wait for
daylight here."</p>

<p>It was a gloomy place, and the silence of those
vast expanses of desolate sand was overwhelming.
It oppressed me strangely.</p>

<p>"Let me feel the touch of your hand," she said
once. "It is so desperately lonely. I have been on
the wide prairie, at night and alone; yet there is
always some sound there upon which the mind may
rest. Here the stillness is like a weight."</p>

<p>Possibly I felt this depressing influence the more
because of my long forest training, where at least the
moaning of limbs, fluttering of leaves, or flitting of
birds brings relief to the expectant senses; while here
all was absolute solitude, so profound that our breathing
itself was startling. The air above appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> 75 </a></span>
empty and void; the earth beneath, lifeless and dead.
Although neither of us was cowardly of heart, yet we
instinctively drew closer together, and our eyes
strained anxiously over the black sand-ridges, now
barely discernible through the dense gloom. We tried
to talk, but even that soon grew to be a struggle, so
heavily did the suspense rest upon our spirits, so
oppressed were we by imaginings of evil. I remember
telling her my simple story, gaining in return brief
glimpses of her experiences in Canada and the farther
West. She even informed me that orders had been
received, the day before she became lost upon the lake,
to abandon Fort Dearborn; that an Indian runner&mdash;whom
she named Winnemeg had arrived from
General Hull at Detroit, bringing also news that
Mackinac had fallen.</p>

<p>"Doubtless your absence has greatly worried
them also," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; none of them knew my plight. Possibly
some may miss me, but they will naturally suppose
I have been at Mr. Kinzie's house all this time.
I have been there often for weeks together, and they
have frequently urged me to take shelter with them.
You see it is far safer there than at the Fort, for even
the most hostile Indians remain on friendly terms
with Mr. Kinzie and his family. He has been there
so many years, and is so just a man in his dealings
with them. 'Tis really strange to see how he leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> 76 </a></span>
his house unguarded, while the garrison at the Fort
is almost in a state of siege. It makes it hard to
realize how imminent is the danger. Yet they are
terribly alarmed at the Fort, and I fear with cause.
Even Mr. Kinzie feels the situation to be critical.
There were fully three hundred Pottawattomie warriors
encamped without the Fort two days ago; and
they were becoming bold and impudent,&mdash;one chief
even firing his gun in Captain Heald's office, thinking
to frighten him into furnishing them with liquor."</p>

<p>"But the Fort is strong?" I asked. "It is capable
of resisting an attack?"</p>

<p>"I should suppose so," she answered, hesitatingly;
"but that is not a matter upon which a girl
may judge. I fear, however, all is not harmony among
its defenders. I know that Captain Heald and Ensign
Ronan do not agree, and I have heard bitter words
spoken by other officers of the garrison."</p>

<p>I thought she did not care to speak more about
this matter, and we drifted off upon other topics, until
I felt her head sink slowly down upon my shoulder,
and knew she slept. I sat there still, pillowing her
tenderly upon my arm, when the gray light of the
dawn stole slowly toward us across the ridges of sand
and revealed the upturned face.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>HE emotion I felt was new
and strange to me; for
though I had known little
of young women, yet as I
looked upon her in that dim
light of dawn I found myself
wondering if I already loved
this strange girl. Fair as
her face certainly was, its
beauty rendered even more striking by the pallor of
her late exposure and the blackness of her dishevelled
hair, it was her frankness and confidence which most
appealed to me. She had held all my thoughts through
the long hours of watchfulness as I sat there quietly,
feeling the rise and fall of her regular breathing, and
thrilled by the unconscious caress of stray tresses as
they were blown against my cheek. How she trusted
me, stranger though I was! Yet it was through no
lack of knowledge of the great world of men, for this
young girl had known court gallants and rough soldiery,
soft-spoken courtiers and boastful men-at-arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> 78 </a></span>
So the night through I dreamed of what might be;
and when the light finally came slowly reddening the
eastern sky, I feasted my eyes unchecked upon that
sweet upturned face, and made a rash vow that I
would win her heart.</p>

<p>I was still mirroring her image in my memory,
forgetful of all else,&mdash;the broad white brow, the long
dark lashes resting in such delicate tracery against
the smooth velvet of the cheek now slightly flushed,
the witching pink of the ear, the softly parted lips
between which gleamed the small and regular teeth
of ivory, the round white throat swelling ever so
slightly to her breathing, when a sudden shout of
surprised recognition aroused me from my reverie,
and I looked up to see Jordan topping the sand-bank
in our front, and waving his hand to some one beneath
him and out of sight.</p>

<p>"See here, De Croix!" he cried, excitedly, "the
prodigal has had good cause to lag behind. He has
found the lost fairy of this wilderness."</p>

<p>Before I could relieve myself of my burden,&mdash;for
the mockery of his words angered me,&mdash;the French
man appeared at his side, and glanced down where his
companion's finger pointed. For a moment he gazed;
then he murmured a sharp French oath, and strode
heavily down the sand-bank. There was a look in his
face that caused me to lay the girl's head back upon
the sand and rise hastily. The sudden movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> 79 </a></span>
awoke her, and her dark eyes looked up in startled
confusion. By this time I had taken a quick step forward,
and faced De Croix.</p>

<p>"This lady is under my protection," I said,
a bit hotly, not relishing the manner of his approach,
"and any disrespect from either of you will be
unwarranted."</p>

<p>He paused, evidently surprised at my bold front,
and his lip curled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Ah, my young game-cock!" he ejaculated, surveying
me curiously. "So you have spurs, and think
you can use them? Well, I have no quarrel with you,
but perchance I may have more reason to be the protector
of this young lady than you suppose. Stand
aside, Monsieur."</p>

<p>She had risen from the sand, and now stood erect
beside me. I saw Jordan grinning in great enjoyment
of the scene, and that De Croix's eyes were full of
anger; but I would not stir. In my heart I felt a dull
pain at his words, a fear that they might prove too
true; but I remained where I was, determined to take
no step aside until she herself should judge between us.</p>

<p>"Will you stand back, Monsieur?" he said,
haughtily, dropping his hand upon the hilt of his
rapier, "or shall I show you how a gentleman of
France deals with such impertinence?"</p>

<p>If he thought to affright me with his bravado, he
reckoned ill of my nature, for I have ever driven badly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> 80 </a></span>
my blood seems slow to heat, though it was warm
enough now.</p>

<p>"If the lady wishes it, you may pass," I answered
shortly, my eyes never leaving his face. "Otherwise,
if you take so much as another step I will crush every
bone in your body."</p>

<p>He saw I meant it, but there was no cowardice in
him; and the steel had already flashed in the sunlight
to make good his threat, when she touched me gently
upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I beg you do not fight," she urged. "I am not
worthy, and 'tis all unneeded. Captain de Croix,"
and she swept him a curtsey which had the grace of
a drawing-room in it, "'tis indeed most strange that
we should meet again in such a spot as this. No contrast
could be greater than the memory of our last
parting. Yet is there any cause for quarrel because
this young gentleman has preserved my life?"</p>

<p>De Croix hesitated, standing half-poised for
attack, even his glib tongue and ready wit failing as
she thus calmly questioned him. Indeed, as I later
learned, there was that of witchery about this young
girl which held him at bay more effectually than if she
had been a princess of the royal blood,&mdash;a something
that laughed his studied art to scorn. She noted now
his hesitancy, and smiled slightly at the evidence of
her power.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur, 'tis not often that your lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"> 81 </a></span>
fail of words," she continued, archly. "Why is it I
am made the subject of your quarrel?"</p>

<p>The slight sarcastic sting in her voice aroused him.</p>

<p>"By all the saints, Toinette!" he exclaimed,
striving to appear at his ease, "this seems a poor
greeting for one who has followed you through leagues
of forest and across oceans of sand, hopeful at the
least to gain a smile of welcome from your lips. Know
you not I am here, at the very end of the world, for
you?"</p>

<p>"I think it not altogether unlikely," she replied
with calmness. "You have ever been of a nature to
do strange things, yet it has always been of your own
sweet will. Surely, Monsieur, I did never bid you
come, or promise you a greeting."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted regretfully, "'tis, alas, true";
and his eyes seemed to regain something of their old
audacity. "But there was that about our parting,&mdash;you
recall it, Toinette, in the shadow of the castle
wall?&mdash;which did afford me hope. No one so fair
as you can be without heart."</p>

<p>She laughed softly, as though his words recalled
memories of other days, pressing back her hair within
its ribbon.</p>

<p>"Such art of compliment seems more in place at
Montreal than here. This is a land of deeds, not
words, Monsieur. Yet, even though I confess your
conclusion partially true, what cause does it yield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> 82 </a></span>
why you should seek a quarrel with my good friend,
John Wayland?"</p>

<p>"You know him, then?" he asked, in quick
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Know him! Do you think I should be here
otherwise? Fie, Captain de Croix, that you, the very
flower of the French court, should express so poor
a thought of one you profess to respect so highly!"</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other of us, scarce
knowing whether she were laughing at him or not.</p>

<p><i>"Sacre!"</i> he exclaimed at last. "I believe it
not, Mademoiselle. The boy would have boasted of
such an acquaintance long before this. You know
him, you say, for how long?"</p>

<p>"Since yester even, if you must know. But he
has a face, Monsieur, a face frank and honest, not
like that of a man long trained at courts to deceive.
'Tis for that I trust him, and have called him friend."</p>

<p>"You may rue the day."</p>

<p>"No, Captain de Croix," she exclaimed, proudly.
"I know the frontiersmen of my father's blood. They
are brave men, and true of heart. This John Wayland
is of that race." And she rested one hand lightly upon
my arm.</p>

<p>The motion, simple as it was, angered him.</p>

<p>"You ask why I sought quarrel," he said sternly.
"'Twas because I suspected this uncouth hunter had
wronged you. Now I understand 'twas of your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
choice. I wish you joy, Mademoiselle, of your new
conquest."</p>

<p>I felt the girl's slight form straighten, and saw his
bold eyes sink beneath the flame of her look.</p>

<p>"Captain de Croix," and every sentence stung like
the lash of a whip, "those are cowardly words, unworthy
a French gentleman and soldier. Did you
leave all your courtesy behind in Montreal, or dream
that in this wilderness I should cringe to any words
you might speak? You wish the truth; you shall have
it. Three days ago, through an accident, I drifted, in
an oarless boat, out from the river-mouth at Fort
Dearborn to the open lake. None knew of my predicament.
A storm blew me helpless to the southward,
and after hours of exposure to danger, and great mental
anguish, I was driven ashore amid the desolation
of this sand. This comrade of yours found me scarce
alive, ministered to my sore need, protected me
through the hours of the night, stood but now between
me and your ribaldry, counting his life but little beside
the reputation of a woman. He may not wear the
latest Paris fashions, Monsieur, but he has proved
himself a man."</p>

<p>"I meant not all I said, Toinette," he hastened to
explain. "You will forgive, I know, for I was sorely
hurt to find that some one else had done the duty that
was plainly mine. Surely no rude backwoodsman is
to come between us now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> 84 </a></span></p>

<p>She glanced from the one to the other, with true
French coquetry.</p>

<p>"Faith, I cannot tell, Monsieur," she said, gayly;
"stranger things have happened, and 'tis not altogether
fine clothes that win the hearts of maidens
on this far frontier. We learn soon to love strength,
and the manly traits of the border. On my word,
Monsieur, this John Wayland seems to have rare
powers of body; I imagine he might even have
crushed you, as he said."</p>

<p>"Think you so?" he asked, eying me curiously.
"Yet 'tis not always as it looks, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>It came so quickly as to startle me. I was wondering
at the smile that curled his lips, when he sprang
upon me, casting his arms around my waist, and twining
one leg about mine. The shock of this sudden
and unexpected onset took me completely by surprise,
and I gave back sharply, scarce realizing his purpose,
till he had the under-hold, and sought to lift me for a
throw. 'Twas my weight alone that saved me, together
with the rare good fortune that I had been
leaning upon my gun.</p>

<p>As the breath came back to me, we locked grimly
in a fierce struggle for the mastery. I had felt the
straining grip of strong arms before, but De Croix
surprised me, he was like steel, quick of motion as
a wild-cat, with many a cunning French wrestling
trick that tried me sorely. I heard a quick exclamation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"> 85 </a></span>
of surprise from the girl, a shout of delighted
approval from Jordan, and then there was no sound
but the harsh trampling of our feet and the heavy
breathing. De Croix's effort was to lift me to his
hip for a throw; mine, to press him backward by
bodily strength. Both of us were sadly hindered by
the sliding sand on which we strove. Twice I thought
I had him, when my footing failed; and once he held
me fairly uplifted from the ground, yet could not make
the toss. 'Twas a wild grapple, for when we had exhausted
all the tricks we knew, it came to be a sheer
test of physical endurance. Then, for the first time,
I felt myself the master,&mdash;though he was a man, that
gay French dandy, and never did my ribs crack under
the pressure of a stronger hand. But I slowly pressed
him back, inch by inch, struggling like a demon to the
last, until I forced his shoulders to the sand.</p>

<p>For a moment he lay there, panting heavily; then
the old frank and easy smile came upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Your hand, monsieur," he said; "that is, if it
yet retains sufficient strength to lift me."</p>

<p>Upon his feet he brushed the sand from out his
long hair, and bowed gallantly.</p>

<p>"I have done my very best, Mademoiselle, 'Tis
defeat, but not disgrace, for I have made your giant
puff to win. May I not hope it has won me restoration
to your good graces?"</p>

</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T would have been impossible not to respond to his
sparkling humor and good
nature, even had the girl
been desirous of doing otherwise. From the first I felt
that she liked this reckless
courtier, whose easy words
and actions made me realize
more deeply than ever my own heaviness of thought
and wit.</p>

<p>As he stood there now, bowing low before her,
his clothing awry and his long hair in disorder from
our fierce contest, she smiled upon him graciously, and
extended a hand that he was prompt enough to accept
and hold.</p>

<p>"Surely," she said mockingly, "no maid, even in
the glorious days of chivalry, had ever more heroic
figures to do battle for her honor. I accept the <i>amende</i>,
Monsieur, and henceforth enroll you as knight at my
court. Upon my word," and she looked about at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> 87 </a></span>
desolate sand-heaps surrounding us, "'tis not much
to boast of here; nor, in truth, is Dearborn greatly
better."</p>

<p>She paused, drawing her hand gently from his
grasp, and holding it out toward me.</p>

<p>"Yet, Captain," she continued, glancing at him
archly over her shoulder, "I have likewise another
knight, this wood ranger, who hath also won my deep
regard and gratitude."</p>

<p>De Croix scowled, and twisted his short mustache nervously.</p>

<p>"You put a thorn beside every rose," he muttered.
"'Twas your way in Montreal."</p>

<p>"A few hundred miles of travel do not greatly
change one's nature. Either at Dearborn or Montreal,
I am still Toinette. But, Messieurs, I have been told
of a camp quite close at hand,&mdash;and yet you leave me
here in the sand to famish while you quarrel."</p>

<p>The tone of her voice, while still full of coquetry,
was urgent, and I think we both noted for the first
time how white of face she was, and how wearily her
eyes shone. The Frenchman, ever ready in such courtesies,
was the first to respond by word and act.</p>

<p>"You are faint, Toinette," he cried, instantly forgetful
of everything else, and springing forward to
give her the aid of his arm. "I beg you lean upon
me. I have been blind not to note your weakness before.
'Tis indeed not a long walk to our camp from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"> 88 </a></span>
here,&mdash;yet, on my life, I know nothing of where it
lies. Jordan," he added, speaking as if he were in
command, "lead back along the path we came. <i>Sacre!</i>
the old bear was gruff enough over the delay of our
search; he will be savage now."</p>

<p>I know not how Jordan ever found his way back,
for the sliding sand had already obliterated all evidences
of former travel; but I walked sullenly beside
him, leaving De Croix to minister to the needs of the
girl as best he might. I felt so dull beside his ready
tongue that, in spite of my real liking for the fellow,
his presence angered me. 'Tis strange we should
ever envy in others what we do not ourselves possess,
ignoring those traits of character we have which they
no less desire. So to me then it seemed altogether
useless to contend for the heart of a woman,&mdash;such a
woman, at least, as this laughing Toinette,&mdash;against
the practised wiles of so gay and debonair a cavalier.
I steeled my ears to the light badinage they continued
to indulge in, and ploughed on through the heavy sand
at Jordan's heels, in no mood for converse with any
one.</p>

<p>We came upon the camp suddenly, and discovered
Captain Wells pacing back and forth, his stern face
dark with annoyance. At sight of me, his passion
burst all restraint.</p>

<p>"By God, sir!" he ejaculated, "if you were a
soldier of mine, I would teach you what it meant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> 89 </a></span>
put us to such a wait as this! Know you not, Master
Wayland, that the lives of helpless women and children
may depend upon our haste? And you hold us here
in idleness while you wander along the lake-shore
like a moonstruck boy!"</p>

<p>Before I could answer these harsh words, the girl
stepped lightly to my side, and standing there, her
hand upon my arm, smiled back into his angry eyes.
I do not think he had even perceived her presence
until that moment; for he stopped perplexed.</p>

<p>"And am I not worth the saving, Monsieur le
Capitaine," she questioned, pouting her lips, "that
you should blame him so harshly for having stopped
to rescue me?"</p>

<p>His harsh glance of angry resentment softened as
he gazed upon her.</p>

<p>"Ah! was that it, then?" he asked, in gentler
tones. "But who are you? Surely you are not unattended
in this wilderness?"</p>

<p>"I am from Fort Dearborn," she answered, "and
though only a girl, Monsieur, I have penetrated
to the great West even farther than has Captain
Wells."</p>

<p>"How know you my name?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heald told me she believed you would
surely come when you learned of our plight at the
Fort, it was for that she despatched the man Burns
with the message,&mdash;and she described you so perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"> 90 </a></span>
that I knew at once who you must be. There
are not so many white men travelling toward Dearborn
now as to make mistake easy."</p>

<p>"And the Fort?" he asked, anxiously. "Is it
still garrisoned, or have we come too late?"</p>

<p>"It was safely held two days ago," she answered,
"although hundreds of savages in war-paint were then
encamped without, and holding powwow before the
gate. No attack had then been made, yet the officers
talked among themselves of evacuating."</p>

<p>For a moment the stern soldier seemed to have
forgotten her, his eyes fastened upon the western
horizon.</p>

<p>"The fools!" he muttered to himself, seemingly
unconscious that he spoke aloud; "yet if I can but
reach there in time, my knowledge of Indian nature
may accomplish much."</p>

<p>He turned quickly, with a sharp glance over his
military force.</p>

<p>"We delay no longer. Jordan, do you give this
lady your horse for to-day's journey, and go you forward
on foot with the Miamis. Watch them closely,
and mark well everything in your front as you
move."</p>

<p>"But, Captain Wells," she insisted, as he turned
away, "I am exceedingly hungry, and doubt not this
youth would also be much the better for a bit of food."</p>

<p>"It will have to be eaten as you travel, then," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> 91 </a></span>
answered, not unkindly, but with all his thought now
fixed on other things, "for our duty is to reach Dearborn
at the first moment, and save those prisoned there
from death, and worse."</p>

<p>I shall always remember each detail of that day's
march, though I saw but little of Toinette save in
stolen glances backward, Wells keeping me close at
his side, while De Croix, as debonair as ever, was
her constant shadow, ministering assiduously to her
wants and cheering her journey with agreeable discourse.
I heard much of their chatter, earnestly as
I sought to remain deaf to it. To this end Wells
aided me but little, for he rode forward in stern silence,
completely absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>During the first few hours we passed through a
dull desolation of desert sand, the queerly shaped hills
on either side scarcely breaking the dead monotony,
although they often hid from our sight our advance
scouts, and made us feel isolated and alone. Once or
twice I imagined I heard the deepening roar of waves
bursting upon the shore-line to our right, but could
gain no glimpse of blue water through those obscuring
dunes. We were following a well-worn Indian trail,
beaten hard by many a moccasined foot; and at last
it ran from out the coarser sand and skirted along the
western beach, almost at the edge of the waves. 'Twas
a most delightful change from the cramped and narrowed
vision that had been ours so long. Our faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> 92 </a></span>
were now set almost directly northward; but I could
not withdraw my eyes from the noble expanse of water
heaving and tumbling in the dazzling sunlight. Indeed,
there was little else about our course to attract
attention; the shore in front lay clear and unbroken,
bearing a sameness of outline that wearied the vision;
each breaking wave was but the type of others that
had gone before, and each jutting point of land was
the picture of the next to follow. To our left, there
extended, parallel to our course of march, a narrow
ridge of white and firmly beaten sand, as regular in
appearance as the ramparts of a fort. Here and there
a break occurred where in some spring flood a sudden
rush of water had burst through. Glancing curiously
down these narrow aisles, as we rode steadily onward,
I caught fleeting glimpses of level prairie-land, green
with waving grasses, apparently stretching to the western
horizon bare of tree or shrub. At first, I took this
to be water also; until I realized that I looked out
upon the great plains of the Illinois.</p>

<p>The Captain was always chary of speech; now
he rode onward with so stern a face, that presently I
spoke in inquiry.</p>

<p>"You are silent, Captain Wells," I said. "One
would expect some rejoicing, as we draw so close to
the end of our long journey."</p>

<p>He glanced aside at me.</p>

<p>"Wayland," he said slowly, "I have been upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> 93 </a></span>
the frontier all my life, and have, as you know, lived
in Indian camps and shared in many a savage campaign.
I am too old a man, too tried a soldier, ever
to hesitate to acknowledge fear; but I tell you now,
I believe we are riding northward to our deaths."</p>

<p>I had known, since first leaving the Maumee, that
danger haunted the expedition; yet these solemn
words came as a surprise.</p>

<p>"Why think you thus?" I asked, with newly
aroused anxiety, my thoughts more with the girl behind
than with myself. "Mademoiselle Toinette tells
me the Fort is strong and capable of defence, and
surely we are already nearly there."</p>

<p>"The young girl yonder with De Croix? It may
be so, if it also be well provisioned for a long siege,
as it is scarce likely any rescue party will be despatched
so far westward. If I mistake not, Hull will have no
men to spare. Yet I like not the action of the savages
about us. 'Tis not in Indian nature to hold off, as
these are doing, and permit reinforcements to go by,
when they might be halted so easily. 'Twould ease
my mind not a little were we attacked."</p>

<p>"Attacked? by whom?"</p>

<p>He faced me with undisguised surprise, a sarcastic
smile curling his grim mouth. His hand swept
along the western sky-line.</p>

<p>"By those red spies hiding behind that ridge of
sand," he answered shortly. "Boy, where are your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> 94 </a></span>
eyes not to have seen that every step we have taken
this day has been but by sufferance of the Pottawattomies?
Not for an hour since leaving camp have we
marched out of shot from their guns; it means treachery,
yet I can scarce tell where or how. If they have
spared us this long, there is some good Indian reason
for it."</p>

<p>I glanced along that apparently desolate sand-bank,
barely a hundred feet away, feeling a thrill of
uneasiness sweep over me at the revelation of his
words. My eyes saw nothing strange nor suspicious;
but I could not doubt his well-trained instinct.</p>

<p>"It makes my flesh creep," I admitted; "yet
surely the others do not know. Hear how the Frenchman
chatters in our rear!"</p>

<p>"The young fool!" he muttered, as the sound of
a light laugh reached us; "it will prove no jest, ere
we are out of this again. Yet, Wayland," and his
voice grew stronger, "the red devils must indeed mean
to pass us free,&mdash;for there is Fort Dearborn, and, unless
my sight deceive me, the flag is up."</p>

<p>I lifted my eyes eagerly, and gazed northward
where his finger pointed.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">W</span>E passed a group of young
cottonwoods, the only trees
I had noted along the shore;
and a few hundred feet
ahead of us, the ridge of
sand, which had obscured
our westward view so long,
gradually fell away, permitting the eye to sweep across
the wide expanse of level plain until halted by a distant
row of stunted trees that seemed to line a stream
of some importance. As Captain Wells spoke, my
glance, which had been fixed upon these natural objects,
was instantly attracted by a strange scene of
human activity that unfolded to the north and west.
The land before us lay flat and low, with the
golden sun of the early afternoon resting hot upon it,
revealing each detail in an animated panorama wherein
barbarism and civilization each bore a conspicuous
part. The Fort was fully a mile and a half distant,
and I could distinguish little of its outward appearance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"> 96 </a></span>
save that it seemed low and solidly built, like
a stockade of logs set upon end in the ground. It
appeared gloomy, grim, inhospitable, with its gates
tightly closed, and no sign of life anywhere along its
dull walls; yet my heart was thrilled at catching the
bright colors of the garrison flag as the western
breeze rippled its folds against the blue background
of the sky.</p>

<p>But it was outside those log barriers that our
eyes encountered scenes of the greatest interest,&mdash;a
mingling of tawdry decoration and wild savagery,
where fierce denizens of forest and plain made their
barbaric show.</p>

<p>No finer stage for such a spectacle could well
be conceived. Upon one side stretched the great waste
of waters; on the other, level plains, composed of
yellow sand quickly merging into the green and brown
of the prairie, while, scattered over its surface, from
the near lake-shore to the distant river, were figures
constantly moving, decked in gay feathers and daubed
with war-paint. Westward from the Fort, toward the
point where a branch of the main river appeared to
emerge from the southward, stood a large village of
tepees, the sun shining yellow and white on their deer-skin
coverings and making an odd glow in the smoke
that curled above the lodge-poles. From where we
rode it looked to be a big encampment, alive with
figures of Indians. My companion and I both noted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"> 97 </a></span>
and spoke together of the fact, that they all seemed
braves; squaws there may have been, but of children
there were none visible.</p>

<p>Populous as this camp appeared, the plain stretching
between it and us was literally swarming with
savages. A few were mounted upon horses, riding
here and there with upraised spears, their hair flying
wildly behind them, their war-bonnets gorgeous in
the sunshine. By far the greater number, however,
were idling about on foot, stalwart, swarthy fellows,
with long black locks, and half-naked painted forms.
One group was listening to the words of a chief;
others were playing at la crosse; but most of them
were merely moving restlessly here and there, not
unlike caged wild animals, eager to be free.</p>

<p>I heard Captain Wells draw in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>"As I live!" he ejaculated, "there can be scarce
less than a thousand warriors in that band,&mdash;and
no trading-party either, if I know aught of Indian
signs."</p>

<p>Before I could answer him, even had I any word
to say, a chief broke away from the gathering mass
in our immediate front, and rode headlong down upon
us, bringing his horse to its haunches barely a yard
away.</p>

<p>He was a large, sinewy man, his face rendered
hideous by streaks of yellow and red, wearing a high
crown of eagle feathers, with a scalp of long light-colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"> 98 </a></span>
hair, still bloody, dangling at his belt. For
a moment he and Captain Wells looked sternly into
each other's eyes without speaking. Then the savage
broke silence.</p>

<p>"Wau-mee-nuk great brave," he said, sullenly,
in broken English, using Wells's Indian name, "but
him big fool come here now. Why not stay with Big
Turtle? He tell him Pottawattomie not want him
here."</p>

<p>"Big Turtle did tell me," was the quiet answer,
"that the Pottawattomies had made bad medicine and
were dancing the war-dance in their villages; but I
have met Pottawattomies before, and am not afraid.
They have been my friends, and I have done them
no wrong."</p>

<p>He looked intently at the disguised face before
him, seeking to trace the features. "You are Topenebe,"
he said at last.</p>

<p>"True," returned the chief, with proud gravity.
"You serve me well once; for that I come now, and
tell you go back,&mdash;there is trouble here."</p>

<p>Wells's face darkened.</p>

<p>"Have I ever been a coward," he asked indignantly,
"that I should turn and run for a threat?
Think you, Topenebe, that I fear to sing the death-song?
I have lived in the woods, and gone forth with
your war-parties; am I less a warrior, now that I
fight with the people of my own race? Go take your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"> 99 </a></span>
warning to some squaw; we ride straight on to Dearborn,
even though we have to fight our way."</p>

<p>The Indian glanced, as Wells pointed, toward the
Fort, and sneered.</p>

<p>"All old women in there," he exclaimed derisively.
"Say this to-day, and that to-morrow. They shut the
gates now to keep Indian on outside. No trade, no
rum, no powder,&mdash;just lies. But they no keep back
our young men much longer." His face grew dark,
and his eyes angry.</p>

<p>"Why you bring them?" he asked hotly, designating
our escort of Miamis, already shrinking from
the taunts of the gathering braves. "They dog Indians,
bad medicine; they run fast when Pottawattomie come."</p>

<p>"Don't be so certain about that, Topenebe," retorted
Wells, shortly. "But we cannot stop longer
here; make way, that we may pass along. Jordan,
push on with your advance through that rabble
there."</p>

<p>The Indian chief drew his horse back beside the
trail, and we moved slowly forward, our Indian guides
slightly in advance, and exhibiting in every action the
disinclination they felt to proceed, and their constantly
increasing fear of the wild horde that now resorted
to every means in their power, short of actual violence,
to retard their progress. As they closed in more
closely around us, taunting the Miamis unmercifully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"> 100 </a></span>
even shaking tomahawks in their faces, with fierce
eyes full of hatred and murder, I drew back my horse
until I ranged up beside Mademoiselle Antoinette, and
thus we rode steadily onward through that frenzied,
howling mass, the girl between De Croix and me, who
thus protected her on either side.</p>

<p>It was truly a weary ride, full of insult, and perchance
of grave peril had we faced that naked mob
less resolutely. Doubtless the chiefs restrained their
young men somewhat, but more than once we came
within a hair's-breadth of serious conflict. They
hemmed us in so tightly that we could only walk our
horses; and twice they pressed upon Jordan so hard
as to halt him altogether, bunching his cowardly
Miamis, and even striking them contemptuously with
their blackened sticks. The second time this occurred,
Captain Wells rode forward to force a path, driving
the spurs into his horse so quickly that the startled
animal fairly cut a lane through the crowded savages
before they could draw back. Naught restrained them
from open violence but their knowledge of that stern-faced
swarthy soldier who fronted them with such
dauntless courage. Hundreds in that swarm had seen
him before, when, as the adopted son of a great war-chief
of the Miamis he had been at their side in many
a wild foray along the border.</p>

<p>"Wau-mee-nuk, the white chief," passed from lip
to lip; and sullenly, slowly, reluctantly, the frenzied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"> 101 </a></span>
red circle fell back, as he pressed his rearing horse full
against them.</p>

<p>How hideous their painted faces looked, as we
slowly pushed past them, their lips shrieking insult,
their sinewy hands gripping at our stirrups, their brandished
weapons shaken in our faces. With firm-set
lips and watchful eyes I rode, bent well forward, so as
best to protect the girl, my rifle held across my saddle
pommel. Twice some vengeful arm struck me a
savage blow, and once a young devil with long matted
hair hanging over his fierce eyes thrust a sharpened
stake viciously at the girl's face. I struck with quick-clinched
hand, and he reeled back into the mass with
a sharp cry of pain. My eyes caught the sudden
dazzle, as De Croix whipped out his rapier.</p>

<p>"Not that, Monsieur!" I cried hastily, across her
horse's neck. "Use the hilt, not the blade, unless you
wish to die."</p>

<p>He heard me above the clamor, and with a quick
turn of the weapon struck fiercely at a scowling brave
who grasped at his horse's rein. He smiled pleasantly
across at me, his fingers twisting his small mustache.
"'Tis doubtless good advice, friend Wayland," he
said, carelessly, "but these copper-colored devils are
indeed most annoying upon this side, and I may lose
my temper ere we reach the gate."</p>

<p>"For the sake of her who rides between us, I
beg that you hold in hard, Monsieur," I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"> 102 </a></span></p>

<p>"'T would be over-much to pay, I imagine, for a hot
brain."</p>

<p>I glanced at her as I spoke, scarcely conscious
even then that I had removed my eyes from the threatening
mob that pressed me, though I know I must
have done so, for I retain the picture of her yet. She
rode facing me, although her saddle was of the old
army type with merely a folded blanket to soften its
sharp contours, and her foot could barely find firm
support within the narrow strap above the wooden
stirrup. She sat erect and easily, swaying gently to
the slow step of the horse. Her face was pale, but
there was no evidence of timidity in her dark eyes,
and she smiled at me as our glances met.</p>

<p>"You are surely a brave girl, Mademoiselle!" I
exclaimed, unable to restrain my admiration. "'Tis
a scene to try any nerves."</p>

<p>"Yet almost worth the danger," she returned
softly, "to realize what men can be in such stress of
need. You are the real&mdash;Beware of that half-breed,
Monsieur!"</p>

<p>Her last words were a quick warning, yet my eyes
were already upon the fellow, and as he dodged down,
knife in hand, to aim a vicious lunge at the forward leg
of her horse, I brought the stock of my rifle crunching
against his shoulder. The next instant we had
passed over his naked body as he lay gasping in the
trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"> 103 </a></span></p>

<p>"See!" she cried, with eagerness. "The gates
are opened!"</p>

<p>We were possibly a hundred yards from the
southern front of the stockade, when I glanced forward
and saw the level ground between a seething
mass of savage forms, so densely wedged together
as to block further progress. I could see hundreds of
brown sinewy arms uplifted from a sea of faces to
brandish weapons of every description, and marked
how the Miamis cowered like whipped curs behind
the protection of Wells's horse, while close beside
him stood Jordan, erect and silent as if on parade, a
rifle grasped in his hands, his head bare, a great welt
showing redly across his white forehead.</p>

<p>A little party, hardly more than twenty infantrymen,
marched steadily out from the open gateway of
the Fort. The first file bore bayonets fixed upon their
guns, and the naked savages fell slowly back before
the polished steel. It was smartly done, and it thrilled
my blood to note with what silent determination that
small band of disciplined men pressed their way onward,
passing through the threatening mass of redskins
as indifferently as if they had been forest trees.
A young, smooth-faced fellow, wearing a new officer's
uniform, led them, sword in hand, a smile of light contempt
upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Clear the space wider, Campbell!" he said
sternly, to the big corporal at his side. "Swing your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"> 104 </a></span>
files to left and right, and push the rabble out of the
way."</p>

<p>They did it with the butts of their guns, laughing
at the brandished knives and tomahawks and the fierce
painted faces that scowled at them, paying no apparent
heed to the taunts and insults showered from every
side. There were some stones thrown, a few blows
were struck, but no rifle-shot broke the brief struggle.
The young officer strode forward down the open space,
and fronted our advance.</p>

<p>"I presume this is Captain Wells, from Fort
Wayne?" he said, lifting his cap as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is," was the reply, "and I am very glad to
find that you still hold Fort Dearborn."</p>

<p>The other's frank and boyish face darkened
slightly, as if at an unpleasant memory.</p>

<p>"'Tis no fault of some," he muttered hastily;
then he checked himself. "We are glad to greet you,
Captain Wells," he added, in a more formal tone,
glancing about upon us, "and your party. I am Ensign
Ronan, of the garrison; and if you will kindly
pass between my guard lines, you will find Captain
Heald awaiting you within."</p>

<p>Thus we rode freely forward, with the guarding
soldiery on either side of us, their faces to the howling
savages; we passed in at the great southern gate, and
halted amid the buildings of old Fort Dearborn.</p>

<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page105_i.png" width="164" height="167" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T makes my old head dizzy
to recall the events of that
hour across the years that
have intervened. Possibly
I, as I write these words, am
the only person living who
has looked upon that old
stockade and taken part in
its tragic history. What a
marvellous change has less than a century witnessed!
Once the outermost guard of our western frontier, it is
now the site of one of the great cities of two continents.
To me, who have seen these events and changes, it
possesses more than the wonderment of a dream.</p>

<p>That day, as I rode forward, I saw but little of
the Fort's formation, for my eyes and thoughts were
so filled with those frenzied savages that hemmed us
about, and the cool deployment of the few troops that
guarded our passage-way, that everything else made
but a dim impression. Yet the glimpse I obtained,
even at that exciting moment, together with the sub
sequent experiences that came to me, have indelibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> 106 </a></span>
impressed each detail of the rude Fort upon my
memory.</p>

<p>It stands before me now, clear-cut and prominent,
its outlines distinct against the background of blue
water or green plains. In that early day the Fort was
a fairly typical outpost of the border, like scores of
others scattered at wide and irregular intervals from
the Carolina mountains upon the south to the joining
of the great lakes at the north, forming one link in the
thin chain of frontier fortifications against Indian
treachery and outbreak. It bore the distinction,
among the others, of being the most advanced and
exposed of all, and its small garrison was utterly
isolated and alone, a forlorn hope in the heart of the
great wilderness.</p>

<p>The Fort had been erected nine years before our
arrival, upon the southern bank of a dull and sluggish
stream, emptying into the Great Lake from the west,
and known to the earlier French explorers as the river
Chicagou. The spot selected was nearly that where
an old-time French trading-post had stood, although
the latter had been deserted for so long that no remnant
of it yet lingered when the Americans first took
possession, and its site remained only as a vague tradition
of those Indian tribes whose representatives
often visited these waters.</p>

<p>The earliest force despatched by the government
to this frontier post erected here a simple stockade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"> 107 </a></span>
of logs. These were placed standing on end, firmly
planted in the ground and extending upward some fifteen feet,
their tops sharpened as an additional protection
against savage assailants. This log stockade
was built quite solid, save for one main entrance,
facing to the south and secured by a heavy, iron-studded
gate, with a subterranean or sunken passage
leading out beneath the north wall to the river,
protected by a door which could be raised only from
within. The enclosure thus formed was sufficiently
large to contain a somewhat restricted parade-ground,
about which were grouped the necessary buildings
of the garrison, the quarters for the officers, the soldiers'
barracks, the commandant's office, the guard-house,
and the magazine. These rude structures were
built in frontier style, of cleaved logs, and with one exception
were but a single story in height, so that their
roofs of rived shingles were well below the protection
of the palisade of logs. Besides these interior buildings,
two block-houses were built, each constructed so
that the second story overhung the first, one of them
standing at the southeast and one at the northwest corner
of the palisaded walls. A narrow wooden support,
or walk, accessible only from one or the other of these
block-houses, enabled its defenders to stand within the
enclosure and look out over the row of sharpened logs.
At the time of our arrival the protective armament
of this primitive Fort, besides the small-arms of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> 108 </a></span>
garrison, consisted of three pieces of light artillery,
brass six-pounders of antique pattern, relics of the
Revolution. Outside the Fort enclosure, only a few
yards to the west along the river bank, stood the
agency building, or, as it was often termed, "goods
factory," built for purposes of trading with the Indians,
so that it would not be necessary to open the
Fort to them. This agency building was a rather large
two-story log house, not erected for any purposes of
defence. Along the southern side of the stream, in
both directions, the soldiers had excavated numerous
root-houses, or cellars, in which to store the products
of their summer gardens,&mdash;these excavations fairly
honeycombing the bank.</p>

<p>Such was Fort Dearborn in August of the fatal
year 1812. It stood ugly, rude, isolated, afar from
any help in time of need. Its nearest military neighbor
lay directly across the waters of the Great Lake,
where a small detachment of troops, scarcely less isolated
than itself, garrisoned a similar stockade near
the mouth of the river Saint Joseph. To the westward,
the vast plains, as yet scarce pressed by the adventurous
feet of white explorers, faded away into a
mysterious unknown country, roamed over by countless
tribes of savages; to the northward lay an unbroken
wilderness for hundreds of leagues, save for
a few scattered traders at Green Bay, until the military
outpost at Mackinac was reached; to the eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"> 109 </a></span>
rolled the waters of the Great Lake, storm-swept and
unvexed by keel of ship, an almost unsurpassable
barrier, along whose shore adventurous voyagers crept
in log and bark canoes; while to the southward alternating
prairie and timber-land stretched away for
unnumbered leagues the Indian hunting-grounds,&mdash;broken
only by a few scattered settlements of French
half-breeds.</p>

<p>From the walls of the Fort the eye ranged over a
dull and monotonous landscape, nowhere broken by
signs of advancing civilization or even of human
presence. A few hundred yards to the east the waves
of Lake Michigan broke upon the wide, sandy beach,
whence the tossing waters stretched away in tumultuous
loneliness to their blending with the distant sky.
Southward, along the shore of the lake, the nearly
level plain, brown and sun-parched, soon merged into
rounded heaps of wind-drifted sand, barely diversified
by a few straggling groups of cottonwoods. To the
westward extended the boundless prairie, flat and bare
as a floor, except where the southern fork of the little
river cut its way through the soft loam, and gave rise
to a scrubby growth of cottonwood and willow; while
northward, across the main body of the river, the land
appeared more rugged and broken, and somewhat
heavily wooded with oak and other forest trees, but
equally devoid of evidences of habitation.</p>

<p>In all this wide survey from the little knoll on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> 110 </a></span>
which the Fort stood, five houses only were visible.
These were built roughly of logs in the most primitive
style of the frontier, and, with a single exception,
were now deserted by their occupants, who had retreated
for safety to the stockade of the Fort. The
single exception was the larger and more ambitious
dwelling standing on the north bank of the river,
occupied by John Kinzie and his family, himself an
old-time Indian trader, whose honesty and long dealing
with the savages had made him confident of their
friendship and fidelity. At one time, however, so
threatening had become the strange bands that flocked
in toward Dearborn, as crows to a feast, he also deserted
his home, and, with those dependent upon him,
sought refuge within the Fort walls; but, influenced
by the pledge of the Pottawattomies, and believing that
safety lay in trusting to their friendship, they had
returned to their own house. The other cabins were
scattered to the westward of the stockade, close to the
river bank. These dwellings had been occupied by the
families of Ouilmette, Burns, and Lee, respectively;
while the last named owned a second cabin, built some
distance up the south branch of the river, and occupied
by a tenant named Liberty White.</p>

<p>The prospect was in truth depressing to one accustomed
to other and more civilized surroundings.
A spirit of loneliness, of fearful isolation, seemed to
hover over the restless waters upon the one hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> 111 </a></span>
those vast silent plains on the other; sea and sky, sky
and sand, met the wearied eye wherever it wandered.
The scene was unspeakably solemn in its immensity
and loneliness; while irresistibly the thought would
wander over those fateful leagues of prairie and forest
that stretched unbrokenly between this far frontier
and the few scattered and remote settlements that
were its nearest neighbors.</p>

<p>It was not until some time later that these sombre
reflections pressed upon me with all their force. After
the excitement of our first boisterous greeting was
over, and I found opportunity to lean across the top
of the guarded stockade and gaze alone over the desolate
spectacle I have endeavored to describe, I could
feel more acutely the hopelessness of our situation and
the danger threatening us from every side. But at the
moment of our entrance, all my interest and attention
had been centred upon the scenes and persons immediately
about me. It was my first experience within the
stockaded walls of an armed government post. The
scene was new to my young senses, and, in spite of the
excitement that still heated my blood, I looked upon it
with such absorbing interest as to be forgetful for the
moment even of the fair girl who rode in at my side.</p>

<p>The dull clang of the heavy iron-bound gate behind
us was a welcome sound after the fierce buffetings
of our perilous passage; yet it only partially shut
off the savage howlings, while above the hideous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"> 112 </a></span>
uproar came the sharp reports of several guns. But
the instant bustle and confusion within scarcely allowed
opportunity to notice this disorder; moreover,
there had come to us a sense of safety and security,&mdash;we
were at last within the barriers we had struggled
so long to gain. However the savage hordes might
rage without, we were now beyond their reach, and
might take breath again.</p>

<p>Our little party, closely bunched together, with
Wells and the timorous Miamis at its head, surged
quickly through between the bars, and came to a halt in
an open space, evidently the parade-ground of the garrison,
the bare earth worn smooth and hard by the
trampling of many feet. A tall flag-pole rose near the
centre, and the wavering shadow of the banner at its top
extended to the eastern edge of the enclosure. Out from
the log-houses which bordered this enclosure there
came a group of people to welcome us,&mdash;officers and
soldiers, women neatly dressed and with bright intelligent
faces, women of rougher mould attired in calico
or deer-skin, hardy-looking men in rude hunter's garb,
picturesque French voyageurs wiry of limb and dark
of skin, an Indian or two, silent, grave, emotionless,
a single negro, and trailing behind them a number of
dirty, delighted children, and dogs of every breed and
degree. It was a motley gathering, and appeared
almost like a multitude as it hurried forth into the
open parade-ground, and surged joyfully about us, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"> 113 </a></span>
eager to welcome us to Dearborn, and hopeful that
we brought them encouragement and relief. We were
of their own race, a link between them and the far-distant
East; and our coming told them they were not
forgotten.</p>

<p>The odd commingling of tongues, the constant
crowding and scraps of conversation, the volley of
questioning from every side, was confusing and unintelligible.
I could gain only glimpses here and there
of what was going on; nor was I able to judge with
any accuracy of the number of those present. I looked
down upon their appealing, anxious faces, with a sad
heart. In some way the sight of them brought back
thoughts of the savage, howling mob without, clamoring
for blood, through which we had won our passage
by sheer good-fortune; of those leagues of untracked
forest amid whose glooms we had ploughed our way.
I thought of these things as I gazed upon the helpless
women and children thronging about me, and my heart
sank as I realized how great indeed was the burden
resting upon us all, how frail the hope of safety.
Death, savage, relentless, inhuman death in its most
frightful guise with torture and agony unspeakable,
lurked along every mile of our possible retreat; nor
could I conceive how its grim coming might long be
delayed by that palisade of logs. We were hopeless
of rescue. We were alone, deserted, the merest handful
amid the unnumbered hordes of the vast West.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"> 114 </a></span>
Swift and terrible as this conception was when it
swept upon me, it grew deeper as I learned more fully
the details of our situation.</p>

<p>Just in front of where I lingered in my saddle, the
crush slightly parted, and I noticed a tall man step
forward, a fair man, having a light beard slightly
tinged with gray, and wearing the undress uniform
of a captain of infantry. A lady, several years his
junior, stood at his side, her eyes bright with expectancy.
At sight of them, Captain Wells instantly
sprang from his horse and hastened forward, his dark
face lighted by one of his rare smiles.</p>

<p>"Captain," he exclaimed, clasping the officer's
hand warmly, and extending his other hand in greeting
to the lady, "I am glad indeed to have reached
you in time to be of service; and you, my own dear
niece,&mdash;may we yet be permitted to bring you safely
back to God's country."</p>

<p>I was unable to catch the reply of either; but I
noted that the lady flung her arms about the speaker's
neck and kissed his swarthy cheek.</p>

<p>Then Captain Wells spoke more loudly, so that
his words reached my ears.</p>

<p>"But, Heald," he said, "what means all this litter
of garrison equipment lying scattered about? Surely
you have no present intention to leave the Fort, in face
of that savage mob out yonder?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the orders of General Hull," was the low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"> 115 </a></span>
and somewhat hesitating response, "and the Pottawattomie
chiefs have pledged us escort around the
head of the lake. But this is no place to discuss the
matter. As soon as possible I would speak with you
more fully in my office."</p>

<p>The look of undisguised amazement upon Wells's
face startled me; and as I glanced about me, wondering
whom I might take counsel with, I was astonished
to note the horse that Toinette had ridden standing
with empty saddle. De Croix, negligently curling his
mustache between his slender fingers, gazed at me
with a blank stare.</p>

<p>"Where is Mademoiselle?" I questioned anxiously,
as he remained silent. "Surely she was with
us as we came in!"</p>

<p>"Pish! of course," he returned carelessly; "if
she chooses to dismount and rejoin her friends, what
has that to do with John Wayland? Cannot the girl
so much as move without your permission, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>The words were insolent, not less than the manner
that accompanied them. Instantly there flashed
upon me the thought that this Frenchman sought a
quarrel with me; but I could conceive no reason there
for, and was not greatly disposed to accommodate
him.</p>

<p>"'Twas no more than curiosity that urged my
question," I answered, assuming not to notice his
bravado. "I was so deeply interested in other things
as to have forgotten her presence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"> 116 </a></span></p>

<p>"Something no lady is ever likely to forgive," he
interjected. "But what think you they propose doing
with us here?"</p>

<p>As if in direct answer to his question, the young
officer who had met us without now elbowed his
way through the throng, until he stood at our horses'
heads.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, with a quick glance into
our faces, "dismount and come within. There is but
little to offer you here at Dearborn, we have been cut
off from civilization so long; but such as we possess
will be shared with you most gladly."</p>

<p>De Croix chatted with him in his easy, familiar
manner, as we slowly crossed the parade; while I
followed them in silence, my thoughts upon the disappearance
of Toinette and the Frenchman's sudden
show of animosity. My glance fell upon the groups
of children scattered along our path, and I wondered
which among them might prove to be Roger Matherson's
little one. At the entrance of one of the log-houses
fronting the parade, a rather ambitious
building of two stories, if I remember rightly, with a
narrow porch along its front, an officer was standing
upon the step, talking with a sweet-faced woman
who appeared scarce older than seventeen.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Helm," said Ronan, politely, "this
is Captain de Croix, of the French army."</p>

<p>He presented De Croix to Mrs. Helm, and then
turned inquiringly toward me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"> 117 </a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I have failed to learn your name?"</p>

<p>"I am simply John Wayland," I answered, and,
with a glance at my face, Lieutenant Helm cordially
extended his hand.</p>

<p>"We are greatly pleased to welcome you both,"
he said earnestly, but with a grave side-glance at his
young wife, "though I fear we have little to offer you
except privation and danger."</p>

<p>"How many have you in the garrison?" I questioned,
my eyes upon the moving figures about us.
"It looks a crowd, in that narrow space."</p>

<p>"They are all there who are able to crawl," he
said, with a grave smile. "But in this case our numbers
are a weakness. In the garrison proper we have
four commissioned officers, with fifty-four non-commissioned
officers and privates. To these may be
added twelve settlers acting as militiamen, making
a total defensive force of seventy men. But fully
twenty-five of these are upon the sick-list, and totally
unfit for active duty; while we are further burdened
by having under our protection twelve women and
twenty children. It almost crazes one to think of what
their fate may be."</p>

<p>"Your defences look strong enough to keep off
savages," broke in De Croix, "and I am told there
is a sufficiency of provisions. Saint Guise! I have
seen places where I had rather reside in my old age;
yet with plenty of wine, some good fellows, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"> 118 </a></span>
lovely women as have already greeted me here, 'twill
not prove so bad for a few weeks."</p>

<p>Helm glanced at him curiously; then his gaze,
always gravely thoughtful, wandered back to me.</p>

<p>"We are to evacuate the Fort," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Evacuate?" echoed the Frenchman, as if the
word were displeasing. "'Tis a strange military act,
in my judgment, and one filled with grave peril. Does
such decision come from a council?"</p>

<p>"There has been no council," broke in Ronan,
hastily. "The commander has not honored his officers
by calling one. Such were the orders as published on
parade this morning."</p>

<p>He would have added more, but Helm warned
him by a sudden look of disapproval.</p>

<p>"I understand," he explained quietly, "that the
instructions received from General Hull at Detroit
were imperative, and that Captain Heald was left no
discretion in the matter."</p>

<p>"I have not yet discovered the man who has seen
the orders," exclaimed the Ensign hotly, "and we all
know it means death."</p>

<p>Helm faced him sternly.</p>

<p>"A soldier's first duty is obedience," he said
shortly, "and we are soldiers. Gentlemen, will you
not come in?"</p>

</span><span class="hidden">A</span>S I sat in the officers' quarters,
listening to the conversation
regarding existing
conditions at the Fort and
the unrest among the Indians
of the border, my
thoughts kept veering from
the sudden and ungracious
disappearance of Mademoiselle
to the early seeking after that hapless orphan
child for whose sake I had already travelled so far
and entered into such danger. Evidently, if I was to
aid her my quest must be no longer interrupted.</p>

<p>With characteristic gallantry, De Croix had at once
been attracted toward Lieutenant Helm's young and
pretty bride, and they two had already forgotten all
sense of existing peril in a most animated discussion
of the latest fashionable modes in Montreal. I was
not a little amused by the interest manifest in her soft
blue eyes as she spoke with all the art of a woman
versed in such mysteries, and at the languid air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"> 120 </a></span>
elegance with which he bore himself. Meanwhile,
I answered as best I might the flood of questions
addressed to me by the two officers, who, having been
shut out from the world so long, were naturally eager
for military news from Fort Wayne and from the seat
of government. As these partially ceased, I asked:</p>

<p>"Has a date been set for the abandonment of the
Fort?"</p>

<p>"We march out upon the fifteenth," was Helm's
reply, "the day after to-morrow, unless something
occurs meanwhile to change Captain Heald's plans.
I confess I dread its coming, much as I imagine a
condemned man might dread the date of his execution,"
and his grave eyes wandered toward his young
wife, as if fearful his words might be overheard by
her. "There are other lives than mine endangered,
and their peril makes duty doubly hard."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," I said, recalled to my own mission
by these words, "I myself am seeking to be of service
to one here,&mdash;the young daughter of one Roger
Matherson, an old soldier who died at this post last
month. He was long my father's faithful comrade in
arms, and with his dying breath begged our care for
his orphan child. It has come to us as a sacred trust,
and I was despatched upon this errand. Can you tell
me where this girl is to be found?"</p>

<p>Before he could frame a reply, for he was somewhat
slow of speech, his wife, who had turned from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"> 121 </a></span>
De Croix, and was listening with interest to my story,
spoke impulsively.</p>

<p>"Why, we have been wondering, Mr. Wayland,
where she could have gone. Not that we have worried,
for she is a girl well able to care for herself, and of a
most independent spirit. She disappeared very suddenly
from the Fort several days ago; we supposed
she must have gone with my mother when Mr. Kinzie
took his family back to their home."</p>

<p>"With Mr. Kinzie?" I questioned, for at that
moment I could not recall hearing the name. "May
I ask where that home is?"</p>

<p>"He is the very good step-father of my wife, and
one she loves as truly as if he were her own father,"
answered Helm, warmly; "a man among a thousand.
Mr. Kinzie is an Indian trader, and has been here for
several years, if indeed he be not the first white settler,
for old Pointe Au Sable was a West Indian
mulatto. His relations with these savages who dwell
near the Great Lake, and especially those of the Pottawattomie
and Wyandot tribes, are so friendly that
he has felt safe to remain with his family unguarded
in his own home. They have always called him Shaw-nee-aw-kee,
the Silver-man, and trust him as much as
he trusts them. He is, besides, a great friend of Sau-ga-nash,
the half-breed Wyandot; and that friendship
is a great protection. His house is across the river, a
little to the east of the Fort; it can easily be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"> 122 </a></span>
from the summit of the stockade. But we have had
no direct communication for several days; the orders
have been very strict since the gates were closed. It
is not safe for our soldiers to venture outside except
in force, and neither Kinzie nor any of his family have
lately visited us. Doubtless they feel that to do so
might arouse the suspicion of their Indian friends."</p>

<p>"But are you sure they are there, and safe? And
do you believe the one I seek will be found with
them?"</p>

<p>"Smoke rises from the chimney, as usual, and
there was a light burning there last evening. We do
not know certainly that your friend is there, but think
such is the case, as she was extremely friendly with
a young French girl in their employ named Josette La
Framboise."</p>

<p>I sat in silence for some time, thinking, and neglectful
of the conversation being carried on around
me by the others, until we were called to supper by
the soldier who officiated as steward for the officers'
mess. I remember many details of the situation, as
they were frankly discussed in my presence while we
lingered at the table; yet my own reflections were
elsewhere, as I was endeavoring to determine my duty
regarding the safety of her whom I had come so far to
aid. Surely, my first object now must be to ascertain
where she was, in order to be at her service when the
hour for departure came. Nor had I any time to spare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"> 123 </a></span>
if we were to march out on the fifteenth. I cannot
describe, at this late day, how strangely my allegiance
wavered, in that hour, between the unknown, unseen
girl, and the fair, vivacious Toinette. My heart drew
me toward the one, my clear duty to the other; and I
could see no way out of the dilemma except to find
Elsa Matherson without delay, in order that the two
should be close together where, as need arose, I could
stand between them and whatever of evil impended.</p>

<p>I fear I was an indifferent guest, for I was never
nimble of tongue, and that night I was more silent
than usual. However, De Croix most effectually hid
my retirement by his rare good-humor and the sparkling
badinage with which he concentrated all attention
upon himself, and was consequently soon in the happiest
of moods. I know not how the fellow succeeded
in working the miracle, but he sat at the board, upon
Mrs. Helm's left hand, powdered and curled as if he
were gracing a banquet at the Tuileries. His ruffled
shirt, glittering buckles, and bright blue waistcoat,
were startling amid such homely surroundings; while
his neatly folded handkerchief of lace exhaled a delicate
perfume. Deeply as I was immersed in my own
thoughts and plans, I could not help admiring his easy
grace, and more than once forgot myself in listening
to his marvellous tales and witty anecdotes.</p>

<p>He was detailing a recent scandal of the French
court, passing delicately over its more objectionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"> 124 </a></span>
features, when I grasped the opportunity to slip unobserved
from the room into the open of the parade-ground.
It proved a dark night without, but the
numerous lights in the surrounding buildings, whose
doors and windows were open, sufficiently illumined
the place, so that I found my way about with little
difficulty. A group of soldiers lounged at the open
door of the guard-house, and I paused a moment to
speak with one, a curly-headed lad, who sat smoking,
his back resting easily against the logs.</p>

<p>"Are the outer gates ever opened at night?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He glanced up at me in surprise, shading his eyes
to be assured of my identity before speaking.</p>

<p>"Scarcely either day or night now, sir," he replied,
respectfully, "but between sunset and sunrise they are
specially barred, and a double guard is set. No one
can pass except on the order of Captain Heald."</p>

<p>"In which direction is the Kinzie house?"</p>

<p>He pointed toward the northeast corner of the
stockade.</p>

<p>"It is just over there, sir, across the river. You
might see the light from the platform; beyond the
shed yonder is the ladder that leads up into the block-house."</p>

<p>Thanking him, I moved forward as directed, found
the ladder, and pushed my way up through the narrow
opening in the floor of the second story. The small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"> 125 </a></span>
square room, feebly lighted by a single sputtering
candle stuck in the shank of a bayonet, contained half
a dozen men, most of them idling, although two were
standing where they could readily peer out through
the narrow slits between the logs. All of them were
heavily armed, and equipped for service. They looked
at me curiously as I first appeared, but the one who
asked my business wore the insignia of a corporal,
and was evidently in command.</p>

<p>"I wish to look out over the stockade, if there is
no objection. I came in with Captain Wells's party
this afternoon," I said, not knowing what their orders
might be, or if I would be recognized.</p>

<p>"I remember you, sir," was the prompt response,
"and you are at liberty to go out there if you desire.
That is the door leading to the platform."</p>

<p>"The Indians appear to be very quiet to-night."</p>

<p>"The more reason to believe them plotting some
fresh deviltry," he answered, rising to his feet, and
facing me. "We never have much to disturb us upon
this side, as it overhangs the river and is not easy of
approach; but the guard on the south wall is kept
pretty busy these last few nights, and has to patrol
the stockade. The Indians have been holding some
sort of a powwow out at their camp ever since dark,
and that's apt to mean trouble sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Then you keep no sentry posted on the platform?"
I asked, a thought suddenly occurring to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> 126 </a></span></p>

<p>"Not regularly, sir; only when something suspicious
happens along the river. There's nobody out
there now excepting the French girl,&mdash;she seems to
be fond of being out there all alone."</p>

<p>The French girl? Could it be possible that he
meant Toinette? I was conscious of a strange fluttering
of the heart, as I stepped forth upon the narrow
foot-way and peered along it, searching for her.
I could distinguish nothing, however; and as I slowly
felt my way forward, testing the squared log beneath
me with careful foot and keeping hold with one hand
upon the sharpened palisades, I began to believe the
corporal had been mistaken. The door, closing behind,
shut off the last gleam of light, and I was left alone in
utter darkness and silence, save for the low rumble
of voices within the Fort enclosure, and the soft plashing
below where the river current kissed the bank at
the foot of the stockade.</p>

<p>I had gone almost the full length of that side,
before I came where she was leaning against the logs,
her chin resting upon one hand, her gaze turned north
ward. Indeed, so silent was she, so intent upon her
own thought, I might have touched her unnoticed in
the gloom, had not the stars broken through a rift in
the cloud above us, and sent a sudden gleam of silver
across her face.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, striving to address her
with something of the ease I thought De Croix would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"> 127 </a></span>
exercise at such a moment, "I meant not to intrude
upon your privacy, yet I am most glad to meet with
you once more."</p>

<p>She started slightly, as though aroused from
reverie, and glanced inquiringly toward me.</p>

<p>"I supposed my visitor to be one of the guard,"
she said pleasantly; "and even now I am unable to
distinguish your face, yet the sound of the voice re
minds me of John Wayland."</p>

<p>"I am proud to know that it has not already been
forgotten. You deserted me so suddenly this afternoon,
I almost doubted my being welcome now."</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, tapping the ends of the logs
with her finger-tips.</p>

<p>"Have you, then, never learned that a woman is
full of whims, Monsieur?" she questioned. "Why,
this afternoon your eyes were so big with wonder that
they had forgotten to look at me. Truly, I spoke to
you twice to aid me from the saddle; but you heard
nothing, and in my desperation I was obliged to turn
to the courtesy of Captain de Croix. Ah, there is a
soldier, my friend, who is never so preoccupied as to
neglect his duty to a lady."</p>

<p>"It was indeed most ungallant of me," I stammered,
scarce knowing whether she laughed at me or
not. "Yet my surroundings were all new, and I have
not the training of DC Croix in such matters."</p>

<p>"Pah! 'tis just as well. I am inclined to like you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"> 128 </a></span>
as you are, my friend, and we shall not quarrel; yet,
with all his love for lesser things, your comrade has
always shown himself a truly gallant gentleman."</p>

<p>I made no answer to these flattering words, for
I felt them to be true; yet no less this open praise of
him, falling from her lips, racked me sorely, and I
lacked the art to make light of it.</p>

<p>"The soldiers in the block-house tell me you come
here often," I ventured at last, for the dead silence
weighed upon me. "You have never seemed to me
like one who would seek such loneliness."</p>

<p>"I am one whom very few wholly comprehend,
I fear, and surely not upon first acquaintance," she
answered thoughtfully, "for I am full of strange
moods, and perhaps dream more than other girls. This
may have been born of my early convent training, and
the mystic tales of the nuns; nor has it been lessened
by the loneliness of the frontier. So, if I differ from
other young women, you may know 'tis my training,
as well as my nature, that may account for it. I have
led a strange life, Monsieur, and one that has known
much of sadness. There are times when I seek my
own thoughts, and find liking for no other company.
Then I come here, and in some way the loneliness of
water and plain soothe me as human speech cannot.
I used to love to stand yonder by the eastern wall and
gaze out over the Great Lake, watching the green
surges chase each other until they burst in spray along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"> 129 </a></span>
the beach. But since I went adrift in the little boat,
and felt the cruelty of the water, I have shrunk from
looking out upon it. Monsieur, have you never
known how restful it sometimes is to be alone?"</p>

<p>"My life has mostly been a solitary one," I answered,
responding unconsciously to her mood, and,
in doing so, forgetting my embarrassment. "It is the
birthright of all children of the frontier. Indeed, I
have seen so little of the great world and so much of
the woods, that I scarcely realize what companionship
means, especially that of my own age. I have made
many a solitary camp leagues from the nearest settlement,
and have tracked the forest alone for days together,
so content with my own thought that possibly
I understand your meaning better than if my life had
been passed among crowds."</p>

<p>"Ah! but I like the crowds," she exclaimed hastily,
"and the glow and excitement of that brighter,
fuller life, where people really live. It is so dull here,&mdash;the
same commonplace faces, the tiresome routine
of drill, the same blue sky, gray water, and green
plains, to look upon day after day. Oh, but it is all
so wearisome, and you cannot conceive how I have
longed again for Montreal and the many little gaieties
that brighten a woman's world. There are those here
who have never known these happier things; their
whole horizon of experience has been bounded by
garrison palisades; but 'tis not so with me,&mdash;I tasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"> 130 </a></span>
of the sweet wine once, when I was a girl, and the
memory never leaves me."</p>

<p>"Yet you are often happy?"</p>

<p>"'Tis my nature, Monsieur, a legacy of my
mother's people; but I am not always gay of heart
when my lips smile."</p>

<p>"And the coming of the French gallant has
doubtless freshened your remembrance of the past?"
I said, a trifle bitterly.</p>

<p>"It has indeed," was her frank admission. "He
represents a life we know so little about here on the
far frontier. To you, with your code of border manliness,
he may appear all affectation, mere shallow in
sincerity; but to me, Captain de Croix represents his
class, stands for the refinements of social order to which
women can never be indifferent. Those were the happiest
days of my life, Monsieur; and at Montreal he
was only one among many."</p>

<p>She was gazing out into the black void as she
spoke, and the slowly clearing skies permitted the star-light
to gleam in her dark eyes and reveal the soft
contour of her cheek.</p>

<p>"You do not understand that?" she questioned
finally, as I failed to break the silence.</p>

<p>"I have no such pleasant memory to look back
upon," I answered; "yet I can feel, though possibly
in a different way, your longing after better things."</p>

<p>"You realize this sense of loneliness? this absence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"> 131 </a></span>
of all that makes life beautiful and worth the
living?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not that,&mdash;for life, even here, is well
worth living, and to my eyes the great sea yonder, and
the dark forests, are of more interest than city streets.
But in one sense I may enter into your meaning; my
thought also is away from here,&mdash;it is with a home,
scarcely less humble than are our present surroundings,
yet it contains the one blessing worth striving
after&mdash;love."</p>

<p>"Love!" she echoed the unexpected word almost
scornfully. "'Tis a phrase so lightly spoken that I
scarce know what it may signify to you. You love
some one then, Monsieur?" and she looked up at me
curiously.</p>

<p>"My mother, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>I saw the expression upon her face change instantly.
"Your pardon," she exclaimed, hastily.
"'Twas not the meaning I had thought. I know
something of such love as that, and honor you for thus
expressing it."</p>

<p>"I have often wondered, since first we met, at
your being here, seemingly alone, at this outermost
post of the frontier. It seems a strange home for one
of your refinement and evident delight in social life."</p>

<p>"'Tis not from choice, Monsieur. My mother
died when I was but a child, as I have already told
you. I scarce have memory of her, yet I bear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"> 132 </a></span>
name, and, I am told, inherit many of her peculiarities.
She was the daughter of a great merchant at Montreal,
and the blood of a noble family of France flowed
in her veins. She gave up all else to become my
father's wife; nor did she ever live to regret it."</p>

<p>Her voice was so low and plaintive that I hesitated
to speak; yet finally, as she ceased, and silence
fell between us, I asked another question:</p>

<p>"And 'twas then you voyaged into this wilderness
with your father?"</p>

<p>"I have never since left him while he lived," she
answered softly, her head resting upon her hand.
"But he also has gone now, and I merely wait opportunity
to journey eastward."</p>

<p>"He was a trader, you told me once?"</p>

<p>"A soldier first, Monsieur; a true and gallant
soldier, but later he traded with the Indians for furs."</p>

<p>I felt that she was weeping softly, although I
could see but little, and I leaned in silence against the
rough logs, gazing out into the black night, hesitating
to break in upon her grief. Then a voice spoke rapidly
at the farther end of the stockade, and a sudden glow
of light shot like an arrow along the platform. I
turned quickly, and there in the open doorway, clearly
outlined against the candle flame, stood De Croix.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">&ldquo;I</span>T looks a narrow walk, my
friend," he said rather doubtfully, peering forward with
shaded eyes, "and 'tis dark
as Erebus; yet gladly will
I make the venture for hope
of the reward."</p>

<p>The door closed behind
him, shutting off the last
vestige of light; and we, with our eyes accustomed
to the gloom, could mark his dim outline as he advanced
toward us. His actions belied his words, for
he moved with all his accustomed jauntiness along the
uncertain foot-way, barely touching the top of the
palisades with one hand to guide his progress. He
was almost upon the girl before he perceived either of
us; and then his earliest words surprised me into
silence.</p>

<p>"Ah, Toinette!" he cried eagerly, "I fear I must
have kept you waiting over-long; yet I was with Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"> 134 </a></span>
Helm,&mdash;a most fair and charming bride,&mdash;and scarce
noted the rapid passage of time."</p>

<p>"I naturally supposed it was a woman," she
answered, with what I interpreted as a strained assumption
of indifference, "as that has ever been your
sufficient reason for breaking faith with me."</p>

<p>"Do not interpret it so, I beg," he hastened to
implore. "Surely, my being a few moments in arrears
is not a matter sufficiently serious to be called a breakage
of faith. I do assure you, Toinette, you were never
once absent from my thought."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" she exclaimed incredulously, and with
an echo of suppressed laughter in her voice. "Then
truly you are far more to be commiserated on this
occasion than I, for in truth, Monsieur de Croix, I
have not missed you over-much. I have enjoyed most
excellent company."</p>

<p>"The mysterious spirits of the starry night?" he
questioned, looking out into the darkness, "or the dim
figures of your own imagination?"</p>

<p>"Very far from either," she retorted, with a
laugh; "a most substantial reality, as you are bound
to confess. Master Wayland, is it not time for you
fitly to greet Captain de Croix? He may deem you
lax in cordiality."</p>

<p>I can perceive now how dearly the laughing witch
loved to play us one against the other, hiding whatever
depth of feeling she may have had beneath the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"> 135 </a></span>
of careless innocence, and keeping us both in an uncertainty
as aggravating as it was sweet. I could not
read the expression upon De Croix's face in the gloom,
yet I saw him start visibly at her almost mocking
words, and there was a trace of ill-suppressed irritation in his voice.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise! 'Twas for that, then, he left us
so mysteriously," he exclaimed, unconsciously uttering
his first thought aloud. "But how knew he you were
to be here?"</p>

<p>Before she could answer, I spoke, anxious to relieve
her of embarrassment; for 'twas ever my nature
to yield much without complaint.</p>

<p>"As it chances, Captain de Croix, she did not
know," I said, standing back from the palisades where
he could see me more clearly. "I left the table below
with no thought of meeting Mademoiselle, and came
out on this platform for a different purpose. As you
know, I am visiting Dearborn upon a special mission."</p>

<p>"Ah, true," and I could feel the trace of relief
in his voice as he instantly recalled my story. "You
also sought a girl in this wilderness,&mdash;may I ask, have
you yet found trace of her?"</p>

<p>I heard Mademoiselle move quickly.</p>

<p>"A girl?" she asked in surprise. "Here, at
Dearborn?"</p>

<p>"She was at Dearborn until very lately, but they
tell me now I must seek for her at the Kinzie house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"> 136 </a></span>
It was for the purpose of marking its position from the
Fort that I came up here."</p>

<p>For a moment no one of our voices broke the
strained silence. I was troubled by this knowledge
of a pre-arranged meeting between these two, yet felt
it was nothing with which I had a right to interfere.
This careless French girl, whom I had known for
scarcely two days, was not one to be easily guided,
even had I either reason or excuse for attempting it.</p>

<p>"'Tis strange," she said, musingly, "that she has
never so much as spoken to me about it; yet she was
always shy of speech in such matters."</p>

<p>"Of whom do you speak, Toinette?" questioned
De Croix.</p>

<p>"Of Master Wayland's young friend with the
Kinzies," she answered, the old sprightliness again
in her voice. "I know her very well, Monsieur,&mdash;a
dear, sweet girl,&mdash;and shall be only too glad to speed
you on to her. Yet 'tis not so easy of accomplishment,
hemmed in as we are here now. Yonder is the light,
Master Wayland; but much of peril may lurk between.
'Tis not far, were the way clear; indeed, in
the old days of peace a rope ferry connected Fort and
house, but now to reach there safely will require a
wide detour and no little woodcraft. There were
patrols of savages along the river bank at dusk, and it
is doubtful if all have been withdrawn."</p>

<p>I looked as she pointed, and easily distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"> 137 </a></span>
the one glittering spark that pierced the darkness to
the north and east. I wondered at her earlier words;
yet they might all be true enough, for I knew nothing
of this Elsa Matherson. Before I could question further,
De Croix had interfered, eager, no doubt, to
be rid of me.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul!" he exclaimed recklessly, "if
I could voyage here from Montreal to win but a smile,
it should prove a small venture for our backwoods
friend to cover yonder small distance. <i>Sacre!</i> I
would do the deed myself for one kiss from rosy lips."</p>

<p>I have wondered since what there was about those
words to anger me. It must have been their boastful
tone, the sarcasm that underlay the velvet utterance,
which stung like salt in a fresh wound. I felt that
from the summit of his own success he durst laugh
at me; and my blood boiled instantly.</p>

<p>"You are wondrous bold, Monsieur," I retorted,
"when the matter is wholly one of words. I regret I
cannot pledge you such reward, so that I might learn
how you would bear yourself in the attempt."</p>

<p>He stared at me haughtily across the shoulder of
the girl, as if doubting he heard aright.</p>

<p>"You question my courage to venture it?"</p>

<p>"It has been my experience that the cock that
crows the loudest fights the least."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Messieurs!" broke in Mademoiselle,
her voice showing suppressed amusement. "This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"> 138 </a></span>
platform is far too narrow to quarrel upon; and, besides,
the condition of the wager is most easily met,&mdash;that
is, if my lips be deemed of sufficiently rosy hue."</p>

<p>I know I stood with opened mouth, so astounded
by these mocking words as to be stricken dumb; but
not so De Croix. The audacity of his nature made
eager response to the bold challenge.</p>

<p>"Do you mean what you say, Toinette?" he
asked, striving to gain a view of her face in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Do I? And pray, why not?" she questioned
lightly. "One kiss is not so very much to give, and
I shall never miss it. 'Tis duller here than at Montreal,
and no doubt 'twill greatly interest me to witness
the race. Surely it will prove a better way to end
your foolish quarrel than to shoot each other. But
come, Messieurs, why do you hesitate so long? is not
the prize enough?"</p>

<p>He bowed gallantly, and took her hand.</p>

<p>"'Twould be the ransom of a king," he answered;
"though first I wish to know the terms of this contest
more clearly."</p>

<p>She looked out into that silent and lonely night,
her eyes upon the distant gleam, and instinctively our
glances followed hers. It was a dull desolation, with
no sound, no movement, in all the black void. The
stars gleamed dull on the water of the river beneath
us, and we could dimly see the denser shadow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"> 139 </a></span>
opposite shore; beyond this, nothing was apparent
save that distant candle flame. What lay between,&mdash;what
strange obstruction of land, what ambushed foes,&mdash;neither
of us had means of knowing. We could
simply plunge into the mystery of it blindfolded by
the fates. Yet to draw back now would brand either
of us forever with the contempt of her who had challenged us so lightly.</p>

<p>"'Tis all simple enough," she said at last, her
eyes glowing with quick excitement. "The goal is
yonder where that light glows so clearly, though I
warn you the longest way round may prove the surest
in the end. To the one of you who reaches there first
and returns here, I am to give one kiss as a measure
of reward. I care not how it may be accomplished,&mdash;such
minor matters rest with your own wits."</p>

<p>"But the young girl we seek," he insisted; "must
she also be brought here upon the return?"</p>

<p>"Pish! what care I what may be done with the
girl? Besides, she is far safer from the savages there
than she would be here."</p>

<p>I saw De Croix lean far out over the sharpened
palisades and peer downward. The movement gave
me instantly a thought of his purpose, and, unnoticed,
I loosened the pistol-belt about my waist and silently
dropped it upon the platform. Whatever desperate
chance he might choose to take, I was determined now
to equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"> 140 </a></span></p>

<p>"Doth the water of the river come to the very foot
of these logs?" he asked, unable to determine in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur, the earth slopes downward for
some feet, yet the current is at this bank, and gives
much depth of water at the shore."</p>

<p>"But of what width is the strip of earth
between?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the length of a tall man."</p>

<p>"Saint Guise! 'tis well I thought to ask!" he
explained jauntily. "And now, Mademoiselle, if you
will but kindly hold this coat and sword, I shall strive
to show you how highly I value the prize offered, and
what a French gentleman can do for love."</p>

<p>I fully grasped his purpose now, and even as he
turned toward her, holding out the valuables he hesitated
to lose, I scaled the low barrier in my front,
planted my feet firmly between the pointed stakes, and
sprang boldly into the darkness.</p>

<p class="caption3">DARKNESS AND SURPRISE</p>


<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page141_i.png" width="171" height="171" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T was a greater distance to
the water than I had supposed, but I struck at last
fairly enough, and went
down until I thought I
should never come up again.
As I rose to the surface and
shook the moisture from my
face and ears, a light laugh
rang out high above me, and Mademoiselle's clear
voice cried mockingly:</p>

<p>"The backwoodsman has taken the first trick,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>I saw De Croix's body dart, like a black arrow,
far out into the air, and come sweeping down. He
struck to my left, and a trifle behind me; but I waited
not to learn just how. With lusty strokes I struck
out for the north shore. It was a hard swim, for my
deerskins held the water like so many bags, and the
current, though not rapid, was sufficiently strong to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"> 142 </a></span>
make me fight valiantly for every foot of way. I came
out, panting heavily, upon a low bank of soft mud,
and crept cautiously up under the black shadow of
some low bushes growing there. I took time, as I
rested, to glance back, hoping thus to learn more of the
direction I should follow; for the Kinzie light was no
longer visible, and my struggle with the current had
somewhat bewildered me. I neither saw nor heard
anything of De Croix; but the flame of the candle
gleaming through the narrow slits of the block-house
told me clearly where it stood, while a wild yelling
farther to the southward convinced me that our Indian
besiegers were yet astir and concocting some fresh
deviltry at their camp. With a half-uttered prayer
that they might all be there, I hastily pressed the
water from my soggy clothes and plunged forward
into the unknown darkness. A big cottonwood, as
from its shape I judged it to be, rose against the stars
in my front,&mdash;a dim outline swaying slightly in the
westerly wind, and I took it as my first guide-mark,
moving over the rough unknown ground as rapidly
and silently as possible.</p>

<p>The soft moccasins I wore aided me greatly, nor
were there many trees along the way to drop twigs
in the path to crackle under foot; yet I found the
ground uneven and deceptive, rifted with small gullies,
and more or less bestrewn with stones, against which
I stumbled in the darkness. I was too thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"> 143 </a></span>
trained in the stern and careful school of the frontier
not to be cautious at such a time, for I knew that silence
and seeming desolation were no proof of savage
desertion; nor did I believe that Indian strategy would
leave the north of the Fort wholly unguarded. Any
rock, any black ravine, any clump of trees or bushes,
might well be the lurking-place of hostiles, who would
only too gladly wreak their vengeance upon any hapless
straggler falling into their hands. I was unarmed,
save for the long hunting-knife I carried in the bosom
of my shirt; but my thought was not of fighting,&mdash;it
was to get through without discovery.</p>

<p>To De Croix I gave small consideration, save that
the memory of the wager was a spur to urge me
forward at greater speed. The place was strangely,
painfully still; even the savage yelling of the distant
Indians seemed to die away as I advanced, and nothing
broke the oppressive silence but an occasional flutter
of leaves, or my own deep breathing. I had gone, I
take it, half or three-quarters of a mile, not directly
north, but circling ever to the eastward, seeking thus
to reach the house from the rear, when I came to a
sharp break in the surface of the land, somewhat
deeper and more abrupt than those before encountered.
It seemed like a cut or ravine made by some rush of
water lakeward; and, as I hesitated upon the edge of
it, peering across and wondering if I had better risk
the plunge, my eyes caught the blaze of the Kinzie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"> 144 </a></span>
light scarce a hundred yards from the opposite bank
of the ravine.</p>

<p>Assured that I was headed right, I stepped off
with a new confidence that, for the moment, conquered
my usual prudence,&mdash;for the steep bank gave way
instantly beneath my weight. I grasped vainly at the
edge, fell heavily sidewise, and rolled like a great log,
bruised and half-stunned, into the black gorge below.
I remember gripping at a slender bush that yielded to
my touch; but all the rest was no more than a breathless
tumble, until I struck something soft at the bottom,&mdash;something
that squirmed and gripped my long
hair savagely, and pushed my head back with a grasp
on the throat that nearly throttled me.</p>

<p>It was all so sudden, so unexpected, that for the
moment I was helpless as a child, struggling merely
from the natural instinct of preservation to break free.
I could perceive nothing, the darkness was so intense;
yet as I gradually succeeded in getting my hands loose,
I wound them in long coarse hair, pressed them against
bare flesh, heard deep labored breathing close to my
face, and believed I was struggling with a savage.</p>

<p>It was a question of mere brute strength, and
neither of us had had the advantage of surprise. I
could feel the sharp prick of my own knife as he
hugged me to him, but I dare not reach for it, and I
held his arms so tightly that he lay panting and struggling
as if in a vise. It was an odd fight, as we turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> 145 </a></span>
and tossed, writhed and twisted among those sharp
pointed rocks like two infuriated wild-cats in the dark,
neither venturing to break hold for a blow, nor having
breath enough in our bodies for so much as a curse.
My adversary struck me once with his head under the
chin, so hard a blow that everything turned red before
me; and then I got my knee up into the pit of his
stomach and caused him to quiver from the agony of
it; yet the fellow clung to me like a bull-terrier, and
never so much as whined.</p>

<p>It was never my nature to yield easily, and I felt
now this struggle was to cost his life or mine; so I
clinched my teeth, and sought my best to push back
the other's head until the neck should crack. But if
I was a powerful man, this other was no less so, and he
fought with a fierce and silent desperation that foiled
me. We dug and tore, gouged and struck, digging our
heels into the soft earth in a vain endeavor to gain
some advantage of position. My cheek, I knew, was
bleeding from contact with a jagged stone, and I was
fast growing faint from the awful tension, when I felt
his arms slip.</p>

<p>"My God!" he panted. "The devil has me!"</p>

<p>So startled was I by these English words, that
I loosed my grip, staring breathlessly through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Are you white?" I gasped, so weakened I could
scarce articulate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> 146 </a></span></p>

<p>For a moment he did not answer, but I could hear
his breath coming in gasps and sobs. Then he spoke
slowly, his voice hoarse from exertion.</p>

<p>"By the memory of Moses! I was once,&mdash;but
that squeeze must have turned me black, I'm thinkin'.
An' ye're no Injun?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as a feather of one," I retorted.
"But that is what I took you to be."</p>

<p>We were both sitting up by this time, he with his
back against the bank, both of us panting as if we
could never regain our breath, and eagerly seeking to
see each other's features in the gloom. Any attempt
at conversation was painful, but I managed at last
to stammer:</p>

<p>"You must be a whalebone man, or I'd have
broken every rib in your body."</p>

<p>"An' I'm not a bit sure ye didn't," was the
response, uttered between puffs. "'Twas the worst
grip ever Ol' Tom Burns had squeeze him,&mdash;an' I've
felt o' bars mor' nor oncet. Who may ye be, anyhow,
stranger? an' for what cause did ye jump down yere
on me?"</p>

<p>There was a trace of growing anger in his tone,
as remembrance of the outrage returned to his mind,
which caused me to smile, now that I could breatheless
painfully. It seemed such a ludicrous affair,&mdash;that
dark struggle, each mistaking the purpose and
color of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> 147 </a></span></p>

<p>"My name is Wayland," I made haste to explain,
"and I left the Fort but now, hoping by this roundabout
route to reach the Kinzie place and return under
cover of darkness. I slipped on the edge of the bank
up yonder, and the next thing I knew we were
at it. I can assure you, friend, I supposed myself
in the arms of a savage. You say your name is
Burns?"</p>

<p>"Ol' Tom Burns."</p>

<p>"What? It is not possible you are the same
who brought a message to Major Wayland on the
Maumee?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I am," he said, deliberately. "An' be
you the boy I met?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, still doubtful. "But how came you
here?"</p>

<p>"Wal, here's whar I belong. I've bin a sorter
huntin' an' trappin' yer'bouts fer goin' on nine year
or so, an' I built a shanty to live in up yonder by the
forks. I hedn't much more nor got home frum down
east, when the Injuns burnt thet down; an' sence then
I ain't bin much o' nowhar, but I reckon'd I'd go inter
ther Fort to-morrow and git some grub."</p>

<p>He spoke with a slow, deliberate drawl, as if not
much accustomed to converse; and I pictured him to
myself as one of those silent plainsmen, so habituated
to solitude as almost to shun companionship, though
he had already let drop a word or two that made me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"> 148 </a></span>
deem him one not devoid of humor. Suddenly I
thought of De Croix.</p>

<p>"Has any one passed here lately?" I asked, rising
to my feet, the old emulation throbbing in my veins.
"A white man, I mean, going north."</p>

<p>"Wal," he answered slowly, and as he also stood
up I could make out, what I had not noted in our
previous meeting, that he was as tall as I, but spare of
build; "I ain't seen nuthin', but some sort o' critter
went ploughin' down inter the gulch up yonder,
maybe ten minutes 'fore ye lit down yere on me. Dern
if I know whether it were a human er a bar!"</p>

<p>"Will you show me the nearest way to the Kinzie
house?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll show ye all right, but ye bet ye
don't git me nigher ner a hundred foot o' the door,"
he returned seriously. "John Kinzie's a mighty good
man, stranger, but he an' Ol' Tom Burns ain't never
hitched worth a cent."</p>

<p>We climbed silently, and came out together upon
the top. A slight beam of light crept along through
the open door of the log house just in front of us, and
for the first time I caught a fair view of my companion.
He was a tall, gaunt, wiry fellow, typical in dress and
manner of his class, the backwoodsmen of the Southwest,
but with a peculiarly solemn face, seamed with
wrinkles, and much of it concealed beneath a bushy,
iron-gray beard. We eyed each other curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"> 149 </a></span></p>

<p>"Dern if ever I expected ter meet up with ye
agin in no sich way as this," he said shortly. "But
thet's the house. Be ye goin' ter stay thar long?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, feeling anxious to have his
guidance back to the Fort, "not over five minutes.
Will you wait?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I may as well," and he seated himself
on a stump.</p>

<p>No one greeted me at the house, not even a dog;
though I could see figures moving within. Either the
occupants felt that an assumption of confidence was
their best security, or experienced no fear of Indian
treachery, for I rapped twice before there was any
response. A young girl, with a face of rare beauty
and a pair of roguish black eyes, peered out curiously.
At sight of a stranger she drew back slightly, yet
paused to ask:</p>

<p>"Did you wish to see some one here?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking for a young girl," I answered, wondering
if this could possibly be she, "and they told
me at the Fort I should probably find her here. May
I ask if you are Elsa Matherson?"</p>

<p>For a moment she looked out at me, as if I might
be an escaped lunatic. Then she turned her face over
her shoulder toward those within.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kinzie," said she, "here's another man
looking for Elsa Matherson."</p>

<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page150_a.png" width="174" height="168" alt="A " />
</span>&nbsp;HEAVILY-BUILT man in
shirt-sleeves, with a strong,
good-humored face, and a
shock of gray hair, appeared beside the girl in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"'Tis not the same scamp
I that kissed you, Josette," he
exclaimed, after examining
me intently in the dim light, "but I doubt not he may
prove of similar breed, and it behooves you to be careful
where you stand."</p>

<p>"Has De Croix been here?" I questioned, scarcely
deeming it possible he could have outstripped me in
our race through the night.</p>

<p>"I know not the rascal's name," was the reply, in
the man's deep voice, "but certain I am there was one
here scarce ten minutes agone asking after this same
Matherson girl. Saint James! but she must have made
some sweet acquaintances, judging from the looks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"> 151 </a></span>
her callers! Josette has been rubbing the fellow's kiss
off her lips ever since he caught her unawares."</p>

<p>"He was a dandified young fellow?" I urged, impatient
to be off, yet eager to be sure.</p>

<p>The girl laughed lightly, her roguish eyes ablaze
with merriment.</p>

<p>"He might be sometime, Monsieur," she cried,
evidently glad to talk, "but to-night he reminded me
of those scare-crows the farmers near Quebec keep in
their fields; a little chap, with a bit of turned-up
mustache, and a bright eye, but rags,&mdash;gracious,
such rags as he wore!"</p>

<p>'Twas De Croix, there could be no doubt of it,&mdash;De Croix,
torn and dishevelled by his mad rush
through the darkness, but with no shred of his reckless
audacity gone. There was naught left, me now but
to race back upon his trail, hopeful for some chance
that might yet allow me to come in first on the return
journey. In my throat I swore one thing,&mdash;the graceless
villain should never collect his reward at both
ends of his journey. He had already stolen the sweets
from Josette's red lips, but he should never claim those
of Mademoiselle. I lingered for but a single question
more.</p>

<p>"But this Elsa Matherson,&mdash;she is not here,
then?"</p>

<p>"No," returned Mr. Kinzie, somewhat gruffly,
"and has not been since the closing of the gates of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"> 152 </a></span>
Fort. I think you are a parcel of mad fools, to be
chasing around on such an errand; yet humanity leads
me to bid you come in. There is not a safe foot of
ground to-night for any strange white man within
three hundred miles of Dearborn."</p>

<p>I glanced about me into the black shadows,
startled at his solemn words of warning. Away to
the southward a faint glimmer told of the location of
the Fort; farther to the west, a sudden blaze swept
up into the sky, reflected in ruddy radiance on the
clouds, and the thought came to me that the savages
had put torch to the deserted cabin on the south branch
of the river.</p>

<p>"No doubt 'tis true," I answered hastily; "yet,
whatever the danger may be, I must regain the stockade
before dawn."</p>

<p>I saw him step forward, as if he would halt me in
my purpose; but, wishing to be detained no longer,
my thoughts being all with De Croix and Mademoiselle,
I turned away quickly and plunged back into
the darkness.</p>

<p>"You young fool!" he called after me, "come
back, or your life will be the forfeit!"</p>

<p>Without so much as answering, I ran silently in my
moccasins to the spot where I had left Ol' Tom Burns.
He sat upon his stump, motionless, apparently without
the slightest interest in anything going on about him.</p>

<p>"Ol' Kinzie was gol-dern polite ter ye, sonny," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"> 153 </a></span>
commented. "Reckon if an Injun was a scalpin' me
right on his front doorstep he'd never hev asked me
ter walk inside like that! He an' me sorter drew on
each other 'bout a year ago, down at Lee's shebang;
an' he don't 'pear ter fergit 'bout it."</p>

<p>"Show me the nearest safe passage to the Fort,"
I said, interrupting him, almost rudely.</p>

<p>He got up slowly, and cast his eyes with deliberation
southward.</p>

<p>"Oh, thar ain't no sich special hurry, I reckon,"
he answered with an exasperating drawl. "We'll be
thar long afore daylight,&mdash;perviding allers we don't
hit no Injuns meantime,&mdash;an' the slower we travel
the less chance thar is o' thet."</p>

<p>"But, friend Burns," I urged, "it is a racing
matter. I must reach there in advance of another man,
who has already been here ahead of me."</p>

<p>"Sol sorter reckoned from what I heerd; but ye
needn't rip the shirt off ye on thet account. The feller
can't git in thar till after daylight, nohow. Them
sojers is too blame skeered ter open the gates in the
dark, an' all the critter'll git if he tries it will be a
volley o' lead; so ye might just as well take it
easylike."</p>

<p>The old man's philosophy seemed sound. De
Croix would certainly not gain admittance until he
could make himself known to the guard, and, carefully
as the stockade was now patrolled, it was hardly probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"> 154 </a></span>
he would be permitted to approach close enough
for identification during the night. De Croix was no
frontiersman, and was reckless to a degree; yet his
long training as a soldier would certainly teach him
a measure of caution in approaching a guarded fort at
such a time.</p>

<p>"Tis doubtless true," I admitted, "yet I shall
feel safer if we push on at once."</p>

<p>"Ye called the feller De Croix, didn't ye?"
he asked. "Is it the French dandy as was at
Hawkins's?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "and I guess you don't care
much to help <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>Burns wasted no breath in reply, but moved forward
with noiseless step. Glancing back, I could
clearly perceive Kinzie framed in the light of his open
door. The vivacious French lass stood beside him,
peering curiously out across his broad shoulders.
Then we sank into the blackness of the ravine, and
everything was blotted from our sight.</p>

<p>Burns evidently knew the intricacies of the path
leading to the Fort gate, for I soon felt my feet upon
a beaten track, and stumbled no more over the various
obstacles that rendered my former progress so uncertain.
My guide moved with excessive caution, as it
seemed to me, frequently pausing to peer forward into
the almost impenetrable darkness, and sniffing the
night-air suspiciously as if hoping thus to locate any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"> 155 </a></span>
lurking foes when his keen eyes failed in the attempt.
So dark was it that I had almost to tread upon his
heels in order to follow him, as not the slightest sound
came from his stealthy advance. As he surmounted
the steeper inclines of land, I was able to perceive him
dimly, usually leaning well forward and moving with
the utmost caution, his long rifle held ready for instant
use. As we drew nearer the river,&mdash;or where I supposed
the river must be, for I could distinguish but
little of our position,&mdash;he swerved from the footpath
we were following, and the way instantly grew rougher
to our feet.</p>

<p>"Reckon we'd better hit the crick a bit below the
Fort," he muttered, over his shoulder; "less likely
ter find Injuns waitin' fer us thar."</p>

<p>"You think there are savages on this shore?"</p>

<p>He turned partially, and peered at me through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"I never heerd tell as Injuns was fools," he answered
briefly. "In course thar's some yere, an'
we're almighty likely ter find 'em."</p>

<p>On the bank of the river, which I could see dimly
by the faint light of a star or two that had broken
through the cloud-rifts, he paused suddenly, sniffing
the air like a pointer dog.</p>

<p>"The gol-dern fools!" he muttered, striking his
rifle-butt on the ground with an expression of disgust.
"They've gone and done it now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"> 156 </a></span></p>

<p>"Done what?" I questioned, almost guessing his
meaning as a pungent odor assailed my nostrils.
"That smells like rum!"</p>

<p>"'Tis rum. Dern if ever I see whar the A'mighty
finds so many blame idjits ter make sojers of! Them
ar' fellers in the Fort wern't in tight 'nough pickle,
with a thousand savages howlin' 'bout 'em, so they've
went an' poured all their liquor inter the river! If
I know Injun nature, it jist means the craziest lot o'
redskins, whin they find it out, ever was on these yere
plains. I bet they make thet fool garrison pay mighty
big fer this job!"</p>

<p>"You mean the destruction of the liquor will
anger them?"</p>

<p>"Anger? It'll drive 'em plum crazy,&mdash;they'll
be ravin' maniacs! It's the hope o' spoils thet's held
'em back so long. They've wanted the Fort to be
'vacuated, so as they could plunder it,&mdash;thet's been
the song o' the chiefs to hold their young men from
raisin' ha'r. But come, sonny, thar's nothin' gained
a-stayin' here, an' dern me if I want ter meet any
Injun with thet thar smell in the air. I don't swim
no river smellin' like thet one does. We'll hev ter
go further up, I reckon, an' cross over by the ol'
agency buildin'."</p>

<p>We crept up the edge of the stream, keeping well
in under the north bank, and moving with the utmost
caution, for the chances were strong that this portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"> 157 </a></span>
of the river would be closely watched by the redskins.
We met with no obstacle, however, nor were we apparently
even observed from the stockade, as we
slowly passed its overhanging shadow. I could distinguish
clearly its dark outlines, even making out a
head or two moving above the palisades; but no hail
of any kind rang out across the intervening water, and
we were soon beyond the upper block-house, where
a faint light yet shone. We could see the dim shape
of the two-story factory building, looking gloomy and
deserted on the south shore. Burns lay flat at the
water's edge, studying the building intently; and his
extreme caution made me a bit nervous, although I
could scarcely determine why, for I had thus far
marked not the slightest sign of danger.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll hev ter risk it," he said at length,
as he bound his powder-horn upon his head with a
dark cloth. "Come right 'long arter me, and don't
make no splashin'."</p>

<p>He slipped off so silently that I scarcely knew he
was gone, until I missed the dark outline of his figure
at my side. With all possible caution, I followed him.
The current was not strong, but I partially faced it,
and struck out with a long, steady stroke, so that my
progress, as nearly as I could judge, was almost directly
across the stream. Burns had been completely
lost to my sight, although as I looked along the
slightly glistening water I could see for some distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"> 158 </a></span>
ahead. I remember a black log bearing silently down
upon me, and how I shrank from contact with it,
fearful lest it might conceal some human thing. Soon
after it had swirled by, my feet touched the shelving
bank, and I crept cautiously up into the overhanging
shadow. Burns was there, and had already reconnoitred
our position; for my first knowledge of his
presence came when he slowly lowered himself down
the bank until he lay close beside me.</p>

<p>"They're thar," he said, soberly. "Thought
most likely they wud be."</p>

<p>"Indians?" I asked, doubtfully,&mdash;for I had an
impression the factory might be garrisoned by some
of our own people.</p>

<p>"Sure; I heerd as how the sojers hed been drawed
in, an' naturally reckoned the Injuns wouldn't be
over-long findin' it out. 'Nother fool thing fer the
sojers ter dew."</p>

<p>He paused, listening intently. In the silence,
above the slight sound of the running water, I felt sure
I could distinguish voices speaking not far distant.</p>

<p>"It's no place yere ter stay," he whispered, his
lips close at my ear. "Reckon best thing we kin dew
now is to find one o' the sojers' root-caves somewhar
along the bank, an' crawl in thar till daylight. The
Injuns ain't so likely to bother us when the guards kin
see 'em from the Fort. They don't want no out-'n'-out
fuss, to my notion, till they kin git inter the stockade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"> 159 </a></span>
for good. Creep 'long yere with me, sonny, an'
't won't be far till I find a hole somewhar thet'll hide
us fer awhile anyhow."</p>

<p>We crawled slowly along, snake-fashion, at the
edge of the river, for perhaps thirty feet, our movements
hidden by the high and slightly overhanging
bank at our left. The night was so dark that Burns
relied more upon feeling than sight to guide him.
At last he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Here's one o' 'em," he said. "Crawl along in,
sonny; thar's lots o' room after ye go a foot er two."</p>

<p>It was the merest hole dug into the bank, roughly
lined with irregular bits of rock, which opened out
into quite a cellar about a yard from the surface. The
air within felt somewhat chill and damp, as I put my
head cautiously down the narrow opening; but there
seemed no cause for fear, and I crept nimbly forward,
feeling my way as I advanced along the rude mud
walls. I could hear Burns behind me on his hands
and knees, puffing slightly as he squeezed through the
small aperture that led into the larger chamber.</p>

<p>I had advanced perhaps two yards without reaching
the end of this odd underground apartment, when
suddenly, and directly in my front, there sounded a
deep, hollow, unearthly groan. The sound was so
terrifying that I stopped with chilled blood and beating
heart, gripping my knife-hilt and peering forward
into the dark as frightened as ever I was in my life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"> 160 </a></span>
I heard Burns gasp and half turn; then, before I could
move, even had I dared venture such a thing, an instantaneous
flash lit up the black interior. I caught
one confused glimpse of a huge object, topped with a
head of tumbled hair, of two flapping wings stretching
out upon either side, and then the impenetrable curtain
of the dark hid everything once more. Sweat
bathed me in cold drops; nor could I have moved
a limb to save my life. Behind me Burns was muttering
what might have been a prayer; when the
thing groaned again, a hollow, awful moan, thrilling
with agony, that sent me grovelling upon my face as
nearly dead as one could well be and yet breathe
and know.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">F</span>OR the moment, every
muscle of my body seemed
paralyzed. I distinctly heard
the creature moving in my
direction, and I backed
away violently, actuated
only by the thought of instant escape into the open
air. But Burns blocked the
solitary passage.</p>

<p>"Back out of here, for God's sake!" I managed
to exclaim through parched lips. "That devil-thing
is coming this way!"</p>

<p>He struggled desperately in the darkness, tugging
madly at some obstacle, an oath smothered on his lips.
I waited and listened, every nerve on edge.</p>

<p>"Dern it all, but I can't!" he groaned at last.
"My blame ol' gun hes got wedged, and won't give
an inch."</p>

<p>Then a half-smothered laugh rippled out of the
gloom just in front of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> 162 </a></span></p>

<p>"Heaven protect me, but it's Wayland!" came a
voice, and the laughter broke into a roar of merriment.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! This will be the death
of me!"</p>

<p>The voice, choked and muffled as it was, sounded
strangely hollow in that dark cave; yet it had a
familiar tone. So surprising was the situation, that
I could only stare into the black void, speechless.
It was Burns who realized the need of action.</p>

<p>"Whoever the dern fool is," he growled, his voice
hoarse with anger, "choke the wind out of him, or his
blame howling will bring every Injun on the river
yere!"</p>

<p>"De Croix!" I exclaimed quickly, aroused to
recollection by the seriousness of the situation, "stop
that infernal racket, or the two of us will throttle
you!"</p>

<p>He puffed and gurgled, striving his best to smother
the sense of ludicrousness that mastered him. To me
there was small cause for merriment; the supreme
terror of those moments merged into hot anger at
the deception, and I crept forward eager to plant my
hand upon the rascal's throat.</p>

<p>"What French mockery is this?" I exclaimed,
my hand hard upon his arm. "Think you, Captain
de Croix, that you can play such tricks in this wilderness,
and not be made to pay for them?"</p>

<p>I felt him tremble under my fierce grasp; yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> 163 </a></span>
it was not from fear, for my words only served to
loosen his laughter once more. Burns now broke in,
shoving the barrel of his long rifle forward over my
shoulder till he struck the Frenchman a blow that
effectually silenced him.</p>

<p>"You chattering ape!" he said, growling like an
angry bear, "another yawp like that, and I'll blow a
hole clean through you! Now, you French ninny, tell
us what this means, an' be quick about it if ye want
ter save yer hide!"</p>

<p>De Croix did not answer, but he ceased to laugh,
and panted as if the breath had been knocked out of
him. Another impatient movement by Burns led me
to speak up hastily in his defence.</p>

<p>"Wait," I said, laying my grasp upon his gun,
"he has no breath left with which to make reply.
'Tis the French gallant who raced with me, the same
whom you met at Hawkins's Ford; and no doubt he
felt good reason to play the ghost here in this dark pit."</p>

<p>"Ay," panted De Croix painfully, "I truly
thought the savages were upon me, and sought to
frighten them by the only means I could devise.
Sacre! but you hit me a sore blow in the ribs! If
I have frightened you, 'twas no worse than the terror
that took me at your entrance here."</p>

<p>For a time none spoke, and no sound, save De
Croix's labored breathing, broke the silence. Burns
had turned slightly, and I knew was listening intently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"> 164 </a></span>
for any sound without. Apparently satisfied that the
noise made by us had not been overheard, he asked
in his old deliberate drawl:</p>

<p>"How in thunder, Mister Parly-voo, did ye git
up thet thar combination, anyhow?"</p>

<p>I heard the Frenchman chuckle, and pinched him
as a warning to be careful. He answered, in his
reckless, easy way:</p>

<p>"'Twas all simple enough behind the scenes,
Messieurs. I but took some old sacking discovered
here, and used it as a robe, standing my hair well on
end; and a flash of powder made the scene most realistic.
The thing indeed worked well. I would I had
a picture of Master Wayland's face to show Toinette!"</p>

<p>This chance mention of her name recalled me
to myself. The undecided wager was yet to be won,
and the night was now nearly spent. There came to
me a sudden determination to risk a rush through the
darkness to the Fort gates, rather than chance any
further defeat at the hands of this rash gallant. Yet
prudence bade me question somewhat further before
I ventured upon so mad a deed.</p>

<p>"No doubt 'twas most happy from your point of
view, Monsieur. From ours, it was less so; and
instead of laughing, you might better be thanking
your lucky stars that you did not pay more dearly
for such folly. But what brought you here? Why
have you failed to reach the stockade?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> 165 </a></span></p>

<p><i>"Sacre!"</i> he muttered carelessly, "but I had a
fierce enough run for it as it was. Why did I not
reach the stockade? Because, my friend, I am no real
ghost to be invisible in the night, nor am I a bird to
fly. 'Twas in the shadow of that big building yonder
that I ran into a nest of those copper-colored fiends,
and 'twas nip and tuck which of us won, had I not,
by pure good luck, chanced to stumble into this hole,
and so escape them. Perchance they also thought
me a ghost, who knows? But, be that as it may,
they were beating the river bank for me in the flesh,
when you came creeping here."</p>

<p>We lay flat on the floor, the three of us, our eyes
fastened upon the faint light that began to stream
in through the entrance. I could hear Burns muttering
to himself, as is often the way with men who lead
lives of solitude; and every now and then De Croix
would shake silently at the recollection of what had
just occurred. I minded neither of them, but chiefly
planned how best I might outwit De Croix and win
the prize offered by Mademoiselle. The promise of
dawning day was in the outer air, too dim as yet to
render our faces visible. Suddenly the slight draft
of air veered, and swept a tiny breath of smoke into
my nostrils. It came so quickly that I scarcely realized
its significance until Burns scrambled to his knees with
a growl.</p>

<p>"God! the devils have run us to cover!" he cried,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> 166 </a></span>
sullenly. "They have started a fire to smoke us
out!"</p>

<p>It hardly needed a moment to prove this true;
the thin smoke grew more and more dense, filling the
narrow entrance until we lay gasping for breath. De
Croix, ever the most impulsive, was the first to act.</p>

<p><i>"Parbleu!"</i> he gasped, pulling himself forward
with his hands. "Better Indians than this foul air!
If I die, it shall at least be in the open."</p>

<p>To remain longer cooped in that foul hole was
indeed madness; and as soon as I could I followed
him, rolling out of the entrance to the water's edge,
fairly sick with the pressure upon my lungs, and
caring so little what the end might be, provided I
might first attain one breath of pure air, that before
I gained strength to resist I was prisoner to as ill-looking
a crew of savages as ever my eyes encountered.
The villains triced us firmly with thongs of skin, and
sat us up against the bank like so many puppets,
dancing about before us, snapping their dirty fingers in
our faces, and treating us to all manner of taunts and
insults. 'Twas done so quickly as to seem a dream,
had I not smarted so sorely from the blows dealt me,
and my limbs chafed where the tight cords were drawn.</p>

<p>I recall glancing aside at Burns; but his seamed
and puckered face remained emotionless, as the red
devils rolled him over till he stared straight up at the
sky, now gray with coming dawn. The sight of De
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"> 167 </a></span>
Croix almost set me laughing, which won for me a
kick from the brute who had me in special charge.
The Frenchman was surely no court dandy now; his
fancy clothing clung to him in rags, while the powder-flash
within the cellar had blackened his face and made
sad havoc with his gay mustache. He endeavored
to smile at me as our eyes met, but the effort produced
only what seemed like a demoniac grin.</p>

<p>"'Tis a hard life, Monsieur," I could not forbear
remarking, "and will hardly remind you of Versailles."</p>

<p>His form stiffened in its bonds, as if the words
spurred his memory of other days.</p>

<p>"A French soldier smiles at fate, wherever it
overtakes him," he answered, a touch of pride in his
voice. "Besides, the game is not played out,&mdash;I may
yet prove the first one in. But see! if I mistake not,
here comes the chief of all these devils."</p>

<p>The new-comer strode down the high bank alone,
and was greeted noisily by our captors. It was the
same Indian that had halted Captain Wells the day
previous; and he looked us over with a contemptuous
sneer that curled his lips and transformed the whole
expression of his hideously painted face. I noted that
he paid but small heed to either De Croix or myself,
contenting his vengeance with sharp kicks at our prostrate
bodies; but as he came to Burns, he paused,
bending down till he could peer into the old borderer's
upturned face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> 168 </a></span></p>

<p>"Bah! I know you," he said, brokenly. "You
Ol' Burns. Stake down in village for you."</p>

<p>The old man neither moved his head nor gave the
slightest sign that he had heard.</p>

<p>"Squaw eat heart," went on the Indian, prodding
him with his stick; "feed bones to dog. All white
men go that way now,&mdash;Ol' Burns first."</p>

<p>"Topenebe," was the quiet reply, as the victim
rolled over until he half-sat against the bank, "I had
the pleasure o' kickin' ye once down on the Kankakee,
an' should be mighty glad ter do it agin. I reckon as
how ye don't feel over friendly ter me, but ye're
simply wastin' yer breath tauntin' me. Any time
yer derned old fire is hot, I'm ready to dance."</p>

<p>These calm words angered the warrior, and he
spat at him; then he turned and grunted an order in
his own language. With blows of their sticks the
Indians got us on our feet; but when they sought to
drive us up the steep bank to the prairie, Ol' Burns
balked and absolutely refused to move.</p>

<p>"Not one dern step, Topenebe," he swore grimly,
"with these yere things on my legs. I'm no pony ter
be hobbled, an' blame if I'll jump 'long fer any red
skin. Ye kin carry me, if ye ain't too lazy; but, by
thunder! thar'll be no walkin' till ye cut them bonds."</p>

<p>Blows, curses, and threats failed alike to budge
the old man. He simply sat down and smiled grimly
at them; and we followed his example, dimly perceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> 169 </a></span>
there must be a purpose in it. Sheer obstinacy
wins many a battle, and when we went up the bank
our lower limbs were free, although to my mind we
were as hopelessly bound as ever. Not so with Burns.
I chanced to press close to him, as we came out upon
the prairie, and he muttered a quick word into my ear.</p>

<p>"See how they herd us in the shade of the Agency!
They are not yet ready to let the sojers know whut
they're re'lly up to. Not an Injun will go beyond
thet line long enough to be seen. Be ready to run
fer it as soon as I say 'Go,' an' tell the Frenchman."</p>

<p>I succeeded in making De Croix understand, by
means of the mongrel French at my command, which
seemed not to be intelligible to the savages; and we
moved forward at as slow a gait as our vigilant guards
permitted, with every muscle tense for the coming
strain. We were bunched together, with no pretence
of order on the part of our captors; indeed, they
seemed to be of various minds over what was to be
done with us, though Topenebe exercised sufficient
control over his mongrel followers to compel at least
partial obedience to his orders. We tramped along to
the west of the factory, the walls of which shut off
all view of the Fort, a half-dozen of the savages about
us, while the chief stalked on a few feet in advance.</p>

<p>We had almost reached the southwestern corner
of the big Agency building, and Topenebe had already
taken a step to the right, carefully keeping the log-walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> 170 </a></span>
as a protection between our movements and the
eyes of the garrison, when Burns, shaking off the
Indians nearest him, bounded suddenly forward and
struck Topenebe with his head, hurling the fellow by
his side over backward as he passed.</p>

<p>"Run for the gate!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Like an arrow from the bow, I shot around the
Agency corner, and raced for the stockade, De Croix,
running like a deer, barely a foot behind me. I never
dreamed, in that moment of intense action, that Burns
was not also coming,&mdash;that he had deliberately sacrificed
himself in order to hold back the savages and give
us the better chance for life. Behind arose the sound
of struggle, but there was no indication of pursuit, and
as I rounded the end of the stockade the lower gate
swung open just before me and I glanced back, half
pausing as I realized the old borderer had not followed
us; then some one tripped me, and I fell headlong.
With a sudden rush, De Croix swept by.</p>

<p>"France wins, Monsieur!" he cried back in mocking
triumph, as I staggered to my knees.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>HOUGH I was never of
hasty or violent temper, it
was quite as well that I
failed to gain a sight of
De Croix as I passed the
posts and the sentry clanged
the gate behind me. The
Frenchman's scurvy trick
would have heated cooler
blood than mine; nor was my spirit soothed by the
harsh fall I suffered. But De Croix had not waited;
nowhere along the bare sunlit parade was he visible.
I saw nothing but a squad of grinning soldiers lounging
beside the barracks, until Captain Wells, issuing
from the guard-house door, caught sight of me and
came forward.</p>

<p>"Back, are you, Master Wayland?" he said
gruffly, and 'twas easy to see he did not approve of
my escapade. "I scarcely thought to see you here
again with so full a head of hair, after I learned of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> 172 </a></span>
your mad wager. Providence must indeed take special
care of fools. Have the redskins captured our French
friend?"</p>

<p>"He entered a step in my advance."</p>

<p>A gleam of amusement played over his swarthy
face.</p>

<p>"Ah, and so you let him win!" he exclaimed;
"he, a mere voyager from the courts, unused to forest
play! Such remissness deserves the guard-house, at
the very least. Come, how happened it that this gay
sprig outfooted you?"</p>

<p>"'Twas but a trick," I retorted, aroused by these
contemptuous words, "and one I shall make him pay
well for. But I pray you cut these bands and set me
free."</p>

<p>I think he had not noticed them before; but now,
as he quickly drew his knife across the deer-skin
thongs, his whole expression changed.</p>

<p>"'Tis Indian tying," he said earnestly; "you
have been in the hands of the savages?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" and the memory of it instantly brought
back the recollection of the sacrifice that had won us
our freedom. "There were three of us taken at daylight
on the river bank, beyond the factory building.
De Croix and I escaped through the efforts of one who
is still a prisoner, and marked for torture."</p>

<p>Many were gathering about us by this time,
anxious to learn whatever news I brought from without;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> 173 </a></span>
but it was Captain Heald himself who now pushed
his way through the throng until he fronted me.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" he asked, sharply. "We have
lost no men!"</p>

<p>"His name is Burns, sir. I ran across him just
back of the Kinzie house."</p>

<p>"Burns? Ol' Tom Burns?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Heald laughed, a look of evident relief on his
haggard features.</p>

<p>"We shall not have to worry much as to his fate,"
he said, turning toward Wells. "You remember the
fellow, William? He was one of Mad Anthony's
scouts, and came west with you in 1803 when you
first held council here."</p>

<p>The other nodded, a twinkle of pleasant recollection
in his eyes. "Remember him?" he repeated.
"I am not likely ever to forget him. He it was who
brought me your message at Fort Wayne a month
ago. My sympathies in this case are entirely with
the Indians. There are likely to be things happening
when Ol' Tom is around, unless he has lost his versatility
and nerve in recent years. Come, my lad,
give us the details of the story, for it must be worth
the hearing if Ol' Burns played a leading part. He
is as full of tricks as a dog of fleas."</p>

<p>I repeated the story briefly, for I was now eager
to be away before De Croix could dress and claim his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"> 174 </a></span>
wager. I knew well the conceited coxcomb would
never seek the presence of Mademoiselle until he had
shed the rags he wore on entering the Fort. I remember
yet that throng of faces, anxious yet amused, peering
over each other's shoulders to get a better view of
me as I talked, and constantly augmented as the word
passed quickly about the garrison that we had safely
returned from our midnight adventures.</p>

<p>"You will send aid to him?" I questioned, as I
concluded, my eyes fixed appealingly upon Captain
Heald.</p>

<p>"Not I," was the prompt and decisive rejoinder.
"No soldier of this command shall leave the stockade
until the hour for our final departure. The fellow had
a chance to come in here with the others before the
gates were closed, but was obstinate as a mule, and
must now take the consequences. But you need not
worry about Ol' Tom, my boy; he'll circumvent those
red devils in some way, you may rest assured, nor
would he even thank us for interference. I have no
force with which to control the horde of savages that
surround us here. A clash of arms would be their
excuse for immediate attack, and might mean death
and torture to the whole garrison. Our only hope lies
in being permitted to pass out without armed collision;
and to do this requires that we ignore such hidden
deeds. 'Twas a mad prank of yours last night, and
might have involved us all in common ruin. Go this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> 175 </a></span>
time free, except for these words of censure; for you
are not directly under my orders. Another such attempt,
subversive of all discipline, and the gates of
Dearborn will be closed against you."</p>

<p>These harsh expressions stung me, but I felt them
in a measure merited, and made no reply.</p>

<p>"'Twas but the act of a boy, Heald," interposed
Wells kindly, resting his hand upon my shoulder,
"and you will find the lad well worth having when
time of trial comes."</p>

<p>I slipped away through an opening in the curious
throng, and hastened across the open parade toward
the mess-room. I felt dust-covered and bruised from
my rough experiences, and hoped to discover opportunities
for a bath. The building called the mess-room
was long, running nearly half the length of the
stockade, built like the others of logs, two stories in
height, and containing a number of rooms. The single
flight of stairs, opening just within the porch, was exceedingly
rude, and built without any protecting rail.
I hesitated a moment when fairly within the entrance,
scarce knowing which way to turn in search of what
I sought; but as I waited there, a light step sounded
upon the bare floor above, and glancing up, with
quickened beat of the heart, my eyes caught the soft
drapery of a woman as she stepped on the upper stair.</p>

<p>I could scarcely have retreated had I wished to
do so, though I realized instantly who it was, and drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"> 176 </a></span>
back against the wall, so that she came down, singing
lightly to herself, without noticing my presence until
we were face to face. It was a picture to touch the
heart of any man, and abide forever in the memory.
I saw the sunlight as it streamed through an upper
window along the rough log wall and flecked her white
dress with ever-changing spots of quivering gold, and,
as she drew nearer to my standing-place, played softly
amid the masses of her dark-brown hair, giving it a
tinge of glory. How daintily fair she was! how archly
sweet looked the clear girlish face under the coquettish
sweep of the broad hat! and with what unconscious
grace she moved down the rude stairway, one white
hand steadying her against the brown logs, the other
gathering her draperies so close that I could not be
blind to the daintily slippered foot that shyly peeped
below the petticoat of ruffled silk. I may not have
loved her then as I learned to do in later days, but my
heart throbbed riotously at her presence, and I stood
forgetful of all else.</p>

<p>As she turned aside at the foot of the stairs, she
saw me, and the color deserted her face, only to
return instantly in deeper volume, while her tell-tale
eyes hid themselves behind long lashes.</p>

<p>"And are you indeed returned, Master Wayland?"
she asked quickly, conquering her first emotion
with a proud uplifting of her head. "You surprised
me greatly. I think I first mistook you for a ghost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> 177 </a></span>
come back to haunt me for having despatched you
on so perilous a quest. You cannot know how I have
been scolded for doing such a thing; yet surely you
would have gone, even if I had failed to encourage it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Mademoiselle," I answered, hoping
I might lead her to speak with greater seriousness;
"but it was the hope of the reward that spurred me
forward."</p>

<p>"Ah, of course," she said deliberately ignoring
her own offer, and with a reckless toss of her head,
"you sought a fair girl for whose sake you have travelled
far. Pray tell me, Monsieur,&mdash;I am so curious
to know,&mdash;do you truly think Josette fairer than I?"</p>

<p>She spoke so lightly, smiling softly into my eyes,
that I hardly detected the faint tinge of regretful
sarcasm in her low voice.</p>

<p>"Josette, you ask me? Why, Josette is indeed a
most charming girl, Mademoiselle; but to my mind
there can be no comparison between her and you, for
you are the fairest woman I have ever known."</p>

<p>Her dark eyes were full upon me, and I saw her
parted lips move as if she would speak. But no words
came, and we stood there silent except for the nervous
tapping of her foot against the floor. Her look
of seriousness changed into a smile.</p>

<p>"By my faith, but you pay compliments with so
grave a countenance, Monsieur, that I hardly know
how to receive them. Most men whisper such things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"> 178 </a></span>
with a light laugh, or a twinkle of the eye, and I
know their words to be empty as bubbles of air. But
you, why, you almost make me feel you are in
earnest."</p>

<p>"And I am," I interrupted, longing to seize her
hand as I knew De Croix would have done, and pour
forth the words that burnt upon my lips. "I have not
been privileged to see much of the great outside world,
Mademoiselle,&mdash;the world of courts and cities,&mdash;nor
do I know how lovely its women may be; but no ideal
formed in dreams satisfies me as you do. I know
naught of idle compliments, nor the graces of a courtier;
but my words are from the heart."</p>

<p>"I do truly believe and trust you, John Wayland,"
and she gave me her hand. "But let us talk of
this no longer. My vanity is already more than satisfied
by your frank and honest speech. And so you
found Josette?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, scarce noting what it was I
said, so puzzled was I by her quick retreat.</p>

<p>"And that meeting, perchance, was so pleasant
that it has taken your thought from all else? It must
indeed be so, or why is it that Master Wayland doth
not claim of me the stake of the wager?"</p>

<p>"Because," I stammered, greatly embarrassed by
her roguish questioning eyes, "I fear it has not been
fairly won."</p>

<p>"Not fairly won?" she echoed, puzzled by my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"> 179 </a></span>
tone and manner. "Surely you have made the trip,
and the terms were plain. Really, Monsieur, you
do not think I would withhold so small a reward from
the winner?"</p>

<p>"But there was another,&mdash;the prize was destined
for him who came back first."</p>

<p>"And has Captain de Croix returned also?"</p>

<p>"We arrived together, Mademoiselle, but it was
his good fortune to be earliest through the gate."</p>

<p>'Twas good to see how her face lit up with the
amusement this reply afforded her.</p>

<p>"Pish! but you are in truth the most marvellous
man I ever knew. 'Tis good to meet with such open
honesty; and when did maid ever have before so unselfish
a cavalier to do her honor? Monsieur, I greatly
doubt if Captain de Croix will prove so thoughtful
when his hour comes."</p>

<p>"You are right, Toinette," broke in a voice at my
back. "I know not what Master Wayland may be
yielding up so easily, but, like the Shylock of your
William Shakespeare, I am here to claim my pound
of flesh."</p>

<p>I wheeled and faced him, standing firmly between
his approach and the girl, my blood instantly boiling
at the familiar sound of that drawling voice.</p>

<p>"I have refused to accept from Mademoiselle
what I had not fairly earned," I said, with quiet emphasis,
"and so, no doubt, will you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> 180 </a></span></p>

<p>There was that about my words and action that
astonished him, and for the moment his old audacity
was gone as he swept a puzzled glance over our faces.
I have often reflected upon the contrast we must have
presented to her sight as we stood there,&mdash;for De
Croix had donned his best attire, and was once again
resplendent in frills and ribbons, with heavily powdered hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, most certainly, what I have not earned," he
said at length, "but the kiss promised is surely mine
by every right, as I was the first in."</p>

<p>"'Twas done by a most scurvy trick."</p>

<p>"Poof! what of that? 'Tis the same whether
the goal be won by wit and strategy, or mere fleetness
of foot. Toinette will make no such fine distinction,
I warrant you."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," and I turned toward the smiling
girl, who seemingly enjoyed our interchange of compliments,
"what may have been your understanding
of this wager?"</p>

<p>"Why," she answered slowly, endeavoring to
recall the details to mind, "Captain de Croix declared
he would willingly make the trip for a touch of rosy
lips, and In a spirit of venture I promised that whichever
of you two first completed the journey and returned
here should obtain such reward."</p>

<p>"There, 'tis plain enough," he cried, stroking his
mustache complacently, "and I have won."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"> 181 </a></span></p>

<p>"Most surely you have," I retorted, "and the
reward has already been given you."</p>

<p>"Been given?" she questioned, "and by whom?"</p>

<p>"The girl Josette."</p>

<p>She looked from the one to the other of us, puzzled
for a brief moment at the odd situation. Then, as her
eyes settled upon De Croix's flushed and angry face,
she laughed gaily, even as she daintily drew aside her
skirts to pass us by.</p>

<p>"Pish, Monsieur!" she cried, shaking her finger
at him, "I doubt it not. No, you need not deny it, for
'tis but one of your old-time tricks, as I knew them
well at Montreal. 'Twould be no more than right
were I even now to reward Master Wayland, for he
hath truly won it,&mdash;yet for that I will delay awhile."</p>

<p>And with a flash of her dark eyes that held us
speechless, she was gone.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">I</span>F any trace of anger held
place in my heart, it utterly
vanished as I noted the bewildered surprise with which
De Croix gazed after Mademoiselle's departing figure.</p>

<p><i>"Sacre!"</i> he exclaimed
presently, turning toward
I me, his face flushed, and forgetful
of all his well-practised graces. "'Twas an
unworthy trick, Master Wayland, and one I am not
likely to forget."</p>

<p>"'Twas a moment ago," I answered, in great
good-humor at his discomfiture, "that you claimed wit
was as important a factor as fleetness of foot in the
winning of a race. I did no more than illustrate your
theory, Monsieur."</p>

<p>The humor of it failed to touch him, and there
was a direct menace in his manner which caused me
to fall back a step in the narrow passage and front him
warily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> 183 </a></span></p>

<p>"No boor of the woods shall laugh at me!" he
exclaimed, his eyes aflame with passion, "be the cause
love or war. What mean all these sly tricks of speech
and action?&mdash;this hurried message to the ear of
Mademoiselle? By my faith, you did not even pause
to wash the dust from off your face before you sought
her company. 'Tis strange such intimacy could spring
up between you in so short a time! But mark you
this, Master Wayland, once and for all; I have not
voyaged here from Montreal to be balked in my plans
by the interference of an uncouth adventurer. I give
you now fair warning that if you ever step again
between Toinette and me, naught but the decision of
steel shall end our quarrel."</p>

<p>That he was indeed in deadly earnest, and indulged
in no vain threat, I well knew; his passion was
too strongly painted on his face. My own temper rose
in turn.</p>

<p>"I hear your words, Monsieur," I returned coldly,
"and care no more for them than for a child's idle
boasting. There is naught between Mademoiselle and
me that the whole world might not know. We are
good friends enough, but if by any chance love should
be born from that friendship, no French gallant, though
he sport a dozen swords, shall come between us. Win
her if you can by reckless audacity and lavishness of
perfume, but dream not to frighten me away from her
presence by the mutterings of bravado. I am the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"> 184 </a></span>
of a soldier, Monsieur, and have myself borne arms
in battle."</p>

<p>"You will fight, then?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, whenever the occasion arises,"
I replied slowly, struggling hard to keep back more
bitter words. "But I see none at present, and, if I mistake
not, all our skill at arms will soon be needed to
save this girl, as well as ourselves, from savage hands."</p>

<p>I know not how we would have parted, for 'twas
evidently his wish to goad me on to fight; and there
are times when passion overwhelms us all. But at that
moment I heard the soft rustle of a dress, and wheeled
to face the fair young wife of Lieutenant Helm. It
was plain she had been weeping; but De Croix, ever
quicker than I in such matters, was first to accost her
in words of courtesy. A pretty face to him was instant
inspiration.</p>

<p>"We bow to you, Madame," he exclaimed with
excessive gallantry, doffing his hat till it swept the
stairs; "your corning makes the very sunshine a
brighter gold."</p>

<p>"I trust it may bring peace as well," she answered,
striving to smile back at him, although trouble yet
shadowed her sweet face; "surely my ears caught the
sound of harsh words."</p>

<p>"A slight misunderstanding, which will hardly
grow to any serious end," he protested.</p>

<p>"I trust not, gentlemen, for the time is come when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"> 185 </a></span>
we women at Dearborn surely need you all to protect
us. Our case already appears desperate."</p>

<p>"Has something new occurred," I questioned
anxiously, "that makes you more alarmed?"</p>

<p>Her eyes, grown strangely serious once more,
swept our faces.</p>

<p>"You may neither of you comprehend this in its
full meaning as clearly as I do," she returned gravely,
"for I am frontier-bred, and have known the Indian
character from childhood. We have long been acquainted,
in my father's family, with many of the chiefs
and warriors now encamped around us. We have
traded in their villages, lived with them in their smoke-stained
tepees on the great plains, and trusted them as
they showed faith in us. You, I learn," and she looked
at me more intently, "were at my father's house no
later than last night. In spite of rumors of war and
tightly guarded Fort gates, you found his door wide
open to whosoever might approach, with never a
dog to bark at an intruder, be he white or red. This
is because the Silver-man has always dealt fairly with
the Indian, and won his respect and gratitude in return.
Now, in time of peril this trader dares to believe
in their good faith toward him and his. 'Tis because
of this I know so well all that is going on without, and
have been able to inform Captain Heald of much his
scouts were unable to discover. From the first there
have been two factions among the savages gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"> 186 </a></span>
yonder; and whether we live or die may depend upon
which counsel prevails among them that of peace or
that of war. Until within an hour I have hoped it
might be peace,&mdash;that the older chiefs would hold
their young men in control, and the red wampum be
not seen at Dearborn. Twenty minutes ago one of the
noblest advocates of peace,&mdash;a Pottawattomie warrior
named Black Partridge,&mdash;sought interview with Captain
Heald, and his words have shown me how desperate
indeed has our situation become."</p>

<p>"He threatened?" broke in De Croix, his hand
upon his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>"Nay, Monsieur, 'tis not the way of an Indian,
nor is Black Partridge one to indulge in vain words.
I have known him long; in childhood I sat upon his
knee, and believe him so friendly to the whites that
naught but a sense of duty could move him otherwise.
Yet, as I say, he came just now to the commandant
of this garrison, and returned a medal once given him
by the government. It was done sadly, and with
deep regret,&mdash;for I overheard his speech. He said:
'Father, I come to deliver up to you the medal I wear.
It was given me by the Americans, and I have long
worn it in token of our mutual friendship. Our young
men are resolved to imbue their hands in the blood
of the whites. I cannot restrain them, and I will not
wear a token of peace while I am compelled to act
as an enemy.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"> 187 </a></span></p>

<p>She stopped, her agitated face buried in her hands,
and neither of us spoke. The solemnity of her words
and manner were most impressive.</p>

<p>"You feel, then, that the die is cast?" asked De
Croix, all lightness vanished from his voice.</p>

<p>"I believe we march forth from these walls to our
death to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But why," I protested, "should you, at least, take
part in such hazard? Your father's family, you tell us,
will be safe from attack. Surely, that home might also
prove your refuge?"</p>

<p>The little woman, with the face of a girl, looked
up at me indignantly through her tears.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Helm marches with the troops," she
answered quietly, "and I am his wife."</p>

<p>I retain no memory, at this late day, of what conversation
followed. I know that De Croix in his easy
carelessness about the future, sought to laugh at her
fears and restore a feeling of hopefulness; but all my
thoughts were elsewhere, upon the grave dilemma
in which we found ourselves, and my duty to these
helpless ones upon every side.</p>

<p>I must have left the two standing there and conversing,
though just how I moved, and why, is dim
to me. I recall crossing the bare parade, and noting
the company that formed the little garrison drawn up
in the shadow of the south stockade. At any other
time I should have paused in interest, for military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"> 188 </a></span>
evolutions always attracted my attention; but then
I had no sense other than that of mental and physical
exhaustion from the hours of toil and lack of rest.
Owing to my absence the night before, no quarters
had been assigned me; but finding the barracks of the
troops unoccupied, and yielding to imperative need,
I flung myself, without undressing, upon a vacant
bunk, and lay there tossing with the burden of intense
fatigue.</p>

<p>And then how the thoughts I sought to banish
thronged upon me! No effort of my will could shut
them out. I went over again and again the quarrel
with De Croix, the incidents of the night, the solemn
words of Mrs. Helm. Little by little, each detail clear
and absolute, there unrolled before my mind's view
the picture of our situation. I saw it as a frontiersman
must, in all its grim probabilities. The little isolated
Fort was cut off from all communication, held by a
weakened garrison. Hope of rescue there was none.
Without were already gathered hundreds of warriors
attracted by rumors of war and promise of pillage;
and these were growing in number and increasing in
ferocity each day. I had ridden through them once,
when their mood was only to annoy, and realized with
a shudder of horror what it would mean to face them
in our retreat, with all restraint of their chiefs removed.
I thought of those long leagues of tangled forest-land
stretching between us and the nearest border settlements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"> 189 </a></span>
of ambuscades, of constant and harassing attack
on the ever-thinning column as we fought for
each foot of the way. Once my mind dwelt for an
instant upon the quiet home I had left on the banks
of the Maumee; as my eyes filled at the memory I
drove it from me, for the present necessity was all too
stern to permit indulgence in such weakness.</p>

<p>'Twas of the women and children I thought most,
and their probable fate if we failed to win a passage.
The half-framed thought of such a possibility made my
heart throb with dread apprehension, as I set my lips
together in firm resolve. What had become of Roger
Matherson's orphan child? 'Twas indeed strange that
I could gain no trace of the little girl. At the Fort
they said she was with the Kinzies, at Kinzies' they
told me she was at the Fort. It was, as Seth had
prophesied, like seeking after a will-o'-the-wisp; yet
surely she must be in the flesh somewhere. My plain
duty was to find her at once; and I resolved to take
up the task anew that day, and question every one I
met till some trace yielded to my persistency. However,
I needed first to sleep; but as I resolutely closed
my eyes, there came gliding into my memory another
face,&mdash;an arch, happy face, with softly rounded
cheeks and dark laughing eyes, a face that mirrored
a hundred moods, and back of them all a sweet
womanly tenderness to make every mood a new and
rare delight. Toinette! never before was woman's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"> 190 </a></span>
name so pleasant to my lips. Ignorant as I was in
mysteries of the heart, I knew not clearly whether I
loved her, though this I knew beyond cavil,&mdash;no
savage hand should ever touch her while I lived; and
if I had to fight each step of the path from that accursed
spot to Wayne, I swore within my heart she
should come safe through. Her gentle memory was
with me when all the rest yielded to the drowsy god,
and in sheer exhaustion I slept&mdash;to dream.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>O my mind, the risk would
be extreme; and I greatly
doubt the wisdom of the
step."</p>

<p>"But, William, what other
alternative offers us any
hope?"</p>

<p>"I confess I know not, for
your last mistake has greatly
aggravated the situation."</p>

<p>I sat up hastily, for seemingly these words were
spoken at the very side of the bunk on which I lay.
As I glanced about me I saw the room was vacant;
so I knew the conference thus accidentally overheard
must be taking place in an adjoining apartment. I
was thoroughly awake when Captain Heald's voice
spoke again.</p>

<p>"You say a mistake,&mdash;what mistake?" he questioned,
as though aggrieved. "I have done no more
than simply obey the orders of my superior officer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"> 192 </a></span></p>

<p>"That may be true," broke in the gentler tones
of Lieutenant Helm, "but of that we are unable to
judge, for not one of your officers has been privileged
to see those orders."</p>

<p>"You shall see them now. If I have been remiss
in taking you into my confidence in these grave matters,
it has been because of certain malcontents in the
garrison with whom I hesitated to confer."</p>

<p>There was a rustle of paper, and Heald read
slowly. I failed to distinguish the opening words, but
as he reached the more important portion of the document
his utterance grew deeper, and I heard distinctly
this sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Evacuate the post if practicable, and in that event distribute
the property belonging to the United States in the Fort, and in the
factory or agency, to the Indians in the neighborhood."</p></div>

<p>There was a pause as he concluded. Captain
Wells spoke first.</p>

<p>"To my mind, these orders are not positive, and
leave much to your discretion. Who brought the
message, and when?"</p>

<p>"A Wyandot named Winnemeg. He reached
here on the ninth."</p>

<p>"I have heard the name, and believe him worthy
of confidence. Did you advise with him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"> 193 </a></span></p>

<p>"Ay! Though he had no oral message from General
Hull, he counselled immediate evacuation. I also
felt such action to be wise; but things were in such
condition within the Fort,&mdash;so large a number of
helpless women and children to be provided for, and so
heavy a proportion of the garrison on the sick-list,&mdash;that
I found it impossible to act promptly. The Indians
gathered so rapidly without, and assumed so
hostile a manner, that I thought it suicidal to attempt
a march through the wilderness, encumbered as we
should be, without some positive understanding with
their chiefs."</p>

<p>"I can easily comprehend all this, and that you
have sought to act for the best," was Wells's comment;
"but I fail to realize how you hoped to appease
those same Indians by the wanton destruction last
night of the liquor thrown into the river. It was done
in direct opposition to the orders you have just read,
and is bound to increase the hatred of the savages.
You may be sure they are not ignorant of the contents
of your despatch, and must resent the destruction of
property they consider their own."</p>

<p>"'Twas done upon the advice of two of their
leading chiefs."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Which two?"</p>

<p>"Topenebe and Little Sauk."</p>

<p>"The two biggest devils in that whole Pottawattomie
camp, and the head and front of their war-party!
Their purpose is clear enough to my mind,
and seamed with treachery. Well, Heald, from my
knowledge of Indian nature I must say that whoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"> 194 </a></span>
goes forth now to confer with yonder redskins has
a desperate mission; but if you are still determined
upon such a conference, I will take my chances with
you. 'Tis given unto man but once to die."</p>

<p>"No, William," replied Captain Heald, with
more firmness. "It is your part to remain here in
protection of your niece, my wife; and if my own
officers refuse to volunteer in this service, I shall
go forth alone to meet the chiefs. It is my duty as
commandant."</p>

<p>"Two of your officers are here," said Wells, "and
they can probably answer for themselves. Ensign
Ronan is not present."</p>

<p>"He is acting as officer of the day," returned
Heald, somewhat stiffly, "and is therefore not eligible
for such service. Perhaps one of the officers here
present possesses courage enough for the venture?"</p>

<p>Apparently neither cared to express himself, after
such an insinuation. At last one, whose voice I recognized
as that of Surgeon Van Voorhis, gave utterance
to his refusal.</p>

<p>"As the only medical officer of the garrison, I feel
justified in declining to go upon so desperate an expedition,"
he said gravely. "It would expose not only
my own life to unnecessary peril, but the lives of many
others as well."</p>

<p>"And what say you, Lieutenant Helm? Have
you also personal scruples?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"> 195 </a></span></p>

<p>I could detect a tremor in the younger officer's
voice, as he answered promptly.</p>

<p>"Captain Heald has before this seen me in time
of danger," he said quietly, "and can have no reason
for ascribing cowardice to me. But I will frankly say
this, sir, and with all respect to my commanding officer,
I believe such conference as now proposed with
the hostile Indians yonder, at this late day, to be perfectly
useless, and that every hour's delay since the
receipt of orders to evacuate the post has only tended
to increase our danger and lessen our hope of escape. I
feel now that our only chance of safety lies in defending
this stockade against attack until a rescue party
from the East can reach us. I have a young wife
among the women of this garrison; to her I owe
allegiance, as well as to the flag I serve. Feeling as
I do, Captain Heald, as a soldier I will obey any
command you give, and will go forth upon this mission
if ordered to do so, either in your company or
alone; but I cannot volunteer for such service. I
believe it to be foolhardy, and that whoever undertakes
it goes forth to almost certain death."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go alone," said Heald, sternly;
"nor do I look forward to any such disastrous ending
to so open a mission of peace."</p>

<p>"Wait," broke in Wells, impulsively. "I have
a final suggestion to make, if you are resolved to go.
There rode in my party hither a rattle-brained gallant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"> 196 </a></span>
bearing a French commission, who ought to prove
sufficiently reckless to lend you his companionship.
Faith! but I think it may well suit the fellow. Be
sides, if he wore his French uniform it might have
weight with the reds."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Heald, doubtfully. "I seem
not to have memory of him."</p>

<p>"He calls himself Captain Villiers de Croix, and
holds commission in the Emperor's Guard."</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words spoken when I was on
my feet, all vestige of sleep gone from my eyes. De
Croix was hardly a friend of mine, since late developments,
but he had been my comrade for many a league
of hard forest travel, and I was unwilling to have him
carelessly sacrificed in a venture regarding the danger
of which he knew nothing. Besides, I counted on his
sword to aid in the defence of Mademoiselle. I understood
thoroughly the desperate chances of Indian
treachery that lay before such a commission as was
now proposed. It was rash in the extreme; and only
the terrors of our position could sanction such an experiment.
The savages that hemmed us in were
already in an ugly mood, and fully conscious of their
power. To go forth to them, unarmed and uninvited,
as Captain Heald coolly proposed doing, was to walk
open-eyed into a trap which treachery might snap shut
at any time. It was not my purpose to halt De Croix,
nor to stand between him and any adventure he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"> 197 </a></span>
choose to undertake; but I could at least warn him,
in a friendly spirit, of the imminent danger such a
thing involved.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind, I ran hastily across
the open parade into the officers' mess-hall, hoping
I might find him loitering there. To my hasty glance,
the place appeared deserted; and I drew back, wondering
where to turn next in search. As I hesitated
on the threshold, the low voice of Mademoiselle fell
upon my ear; and at that moment she emerged from
behind the curtain which divided the officers' quarters.</p>

<p>"May I hope you are seeking me?" she asked,
graciously; "for it has been most lonely here all day,
even Captain de Croix seems to have forgotten my
existence."</p>

<p>"It was De Croix I sought," I answered, somewhat
nettled by her prompt reference to him; "and
doubtless you are well able to give me trace of him."</p>

<p>She studied me keenly, marking an angry note in
my voice that I sought vainly to disguise.</p>

<p>"Forever a quarrel?" she said, regretfully. "Do
you know, Master Wayland, I had thought better of
you. Surely it is not your nature to be a brawler, and
always seeking opportunity to show the strong hand!
What has Captain de Croix done now to make you
seek him so vengefully?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not in quarrel," I explained,&mdash;I fear with
ill grace, for her words in his defence were little inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"> 198 </a></span>
to mollify me. "You may indeed have so poor
conception of me as to misinterpret my coming; yet
in truth I seek De Croix in friendship, hoping that
I may by a chance word serve him."</p>

<p>"Indeed! what danger threatens, that he needs
to be warned against?"</p>

<p>I hesitated; for, now that my blood had somewhat
cooled, my mission seemed a bit foolish.</p>

<p>"I insist upon knowing," she continued haughtily,
her eyes full upon mine, "or I shall believe you
sought him for hostile purpose, and would deceive me
by fair words."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I answered gravely, "you do
me wrong. Only a few moments ago I chanced to
overhear a discussion, by the officers of this Fort, regarding
a commission to go forth and hold council
with the Indians. Captain Heald is determined upon
such a course; but none will volunteer to accompany
him, because of the grave danger of savage treachery.
The Frenchman's name was mentioned as one reckless
enough to join with such a party; and I sought to
warn him ere he accepted blindly. He is hardly a
friend of mine,&mdash;yet it seems no more than fair that
he should know the full measure of his peril before
saying 'yes.'"</p>

<p>She came impulsively forward, with quickly extended
hand, her face aglow.</p>

<p>"You are indeed a true heart, John Wayland, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"> 199 </a></span>
have shamed me rightly. I know well the deceit and
treachery of Indian nature, and can understand the
peril such a party would run. Promise me that you
will prevent Captain de Croix from becoming one of
them."</p>

<p>"I?" I exclaimed in perplexed surprise; "I can
do no more than warn him."</p>

<p>"But you must do more!" she cried imperatively.
"He will surely go if asked. A warning such as you
propose would only stir his blood. I beg you to
use your wits a little, so that he may know nothing
of it."</p>

<p>I looked at her, deeply hurt by the interest so
openly displayed.</p>

<p>"You are wondrously aroused for the Frenchman's
safety, Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, though not as you may fancy. Captain de
Croix came here for my sake, even though no word
of mine gave him reason for doing so. For this reason
I could never forgive myself if harm befell him on such
a journey. 'Twould be as if I had lured him to his
death. So 'tis for my sake, not his, that I ask the
favor."</p>

<p>I leaned against the log wall and thought quickly,
her anxious eyes never leaving my face. There came
into my mind a conviction that the girl really loved
him; and this made the struggle harder for me to
serve him. Nor did I see clearly how it could well be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"> 200 </a></span>
done, save through a sacrifice of myself, such as I
had never intended.</p>

<p>"Surely," she urged, "your wits will conceive
some way in which it may be done?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, eager now to hide my own
feeling from her; "'tis not hopeless. You desire
that he be kept within the Fort, ignorant of this
commission?"</p>

<p>"I do; 'tis the only way."</p>

<p>"Very well, it shall be done, Mademoiselle. No,
I need no thanks from you. Only do this simple thing,
which, I am sure, you will find no hardship,&mdash;keep
Captain de Croix from any possible contact with others
for an hour. Your eyes will prove sufficient, no doubt,
to enchain him that long; if not, use other measures."</p>

<p>"But what will you do?"</p>

<p>"That does not count. 'Tis the result, not the
means, that must content you. I have my plan, and it
will work; but I cannot stay here longer to discuss it.
Only do your part well, and I pledge you the safety
of De Croix."</p>

<p>I left her standing there, the light of questioning
still in her eyes; but I wished mainly to be safely
away, where I might hide my own sudden heart-ache
in the energy of action.</p>

<p class="caption3">IN THE INDIAN CAMP</p>


<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page201_i.png" width="176" height="177" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T cut me deeply to think
that this girl would willingly
sacrifice me to save the
French gallant from injury,
and an anxiety to escape her
presence before I should
speak words I might always
regret caused me to leave
with scant ceremony. Yet I
was none too soon; for scarce had I stepped without the
door when I met Lieutenant Helm ascending the steps.
"Ah, Wayland!" he said, catching sight of me,
"do you happen to know where I am most likely to
find Captain de Croix?"</p>

<p>"He is scarcely to be disturbed at present, unless
the matter be truly urgent," I replied, my plan hastily
sketched in mind. "Have you arranged a banquet in
honor of the Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"No such good fortune," was the grave response.
"Captain Heald desires his company upon an immediate
mission to the Pottawattomie camp."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> 202 </a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? Well, Captain de Croix will
hardly be found sufficiently recovered from his late
adventure to enter upon another one so early. 'Tis
in my thought he either sleeps or is prinking himself
for more pleasant conquests. But why worry him?
In my judgment, no poorer choice could be made for
so serious a task as you propose. He is a mere French
courtier,&mdash;brave enough, and rash, I grant, yet without
knowledge of Indian ways and treachery. Might
not I answer better as his substitute?"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Ay! and why not? I am frontier-bred, long
trained in woodcraft and savage ways, and surely far
better fitted for such a task than is this petted darling
of the courts. Were it a flirtation, now, the post might
be truly his."</p>

<p>"'Tis true, you would be my choice; but do you
realize the peril involved?"</p>

<p>"Fully, my friend, yet scarce think it so desperate
as you imagine. It is my judgment the savages yonder
are seeking bigger game than so small a party would
afford, and will therefore allow us to go free. However,
if it should prove otherwise," and I spoke the words
with a sore heart as I recalled what had just occurred,
"I am a lone man in the world, and to such an one
death is not so terrible, even at Indian hands. Come,
I will go with you to confer with Captain Heald, and
offer him my services. He can do no more than refuse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"> 203 </a></span></p>

<p>Helm offered no further objection, doubtless
feeling it useless in my venturesome mood; and we
crossed the parade together without speaking.</p>

<p>Captain Wells was the first to see me as we entered,
and some instinct told him instantly of my
purpose.</p>

<p>"Ah, Wayland, my boy! I have been troubled
lest you might chance to hear of our plight, and jump
in. Come now, lad! 'twas not you we sent after, nor
can we use you in so grave a matter."</p>

<p>"And pray, why not?" I questioned, a little
touched by this evidence of kindness, yet firmly determined
to keep my pledge to Mademoiselle. "I am
a better man for such deeds than the Frenchman, and
am eager to go."</p>

<p>"So this is not your Captain de Croix?" said
Captain Heald, eying me curiously. "Saint George!
but he is a big fellow,&mdash;the same who made the race
last night, or I mistake greatly. And what is this
man's name?"</p>

<p>"It is John Wayland," I answered, anxious to
impress him favorably; "a frontiersman of the
Maumee country, and fairly skilled in Indian ways.
I have come to volunteer my services to go with
you."</p>

<p>"You are anxious to die? have the spirit of a
Jesuit, perchance, and are ambitious of martyrdom?"</p>

<p>"Not unusually so, sir, but I think the danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"> 204 </a></span>
overrated by these gentlemen. At least, I am ready
and willing to go."</p>

<p>"And so you shall, lad!" cried the old soldier,
striking a hand upon his knee. "You are of the race
of the long rifles; I know your kind well. Not another
word, William! here is a man worth any twenty of your
French beaux strutting with a sword. Now we start
at once, and shall have this matter settled speedily."</p>

<p>The earliest haze of the fast-descending twilight
was hovering over the level plain as we two went forth.
In the west, the red tinge of the sun, which had just
disappeared below the horizon, lingered well up in
the sky. Against it we could see, clearly outlined in
inky blackness, the distant Indian wigwams; while
to the eastward the crimson light was reflected in
fantastic glow upon the heaving surface of the lake.
For a moment we paused, standing upon the slope of
the mound on which the Fort was built, and gazed
about us. There was little movement to arrest the eye.
The dull, dreary level of shore and prairie was deserted;
what the more distant mounds of sand or
the overhanging river banks might hide of savage
watchers, we could only conjecture. Seemingly the
mass of Indian life, which only the day before had
overflowed that vacant space, had vanished as if by
some sorcerer's magic. To me, this unexpected silence
and dreary barrenness were astounding; I gazed
about me fairly bewildered, almost dreaming for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"> 205 </a></span>
moment that our foes had lifted the long siege and
departed while I slept. Heald no doubt read the
thought in my eyes, for he laid a kindly hand upon my
sleeve and pointed westward.</p>

<p>"They are all yonder, lad, at the camp,&mdash;in council,
like enough. Mark you, Wayland, how much
farther to the south the limit of their camp extends
than when the sun sank last night? Saint George!
they must have added all of fifty wigwams to their
village! They gather like crows about a dead body.
It has an ugly look."</p>

<p>"Yet 'tis strange they leave the Fort unguarded,
so that the garrison may come and go unhindered.
'Tis not the usual practice of Indian warfare."</p>

<p>"Unguarded? Faith! the hundreds of miles of
wilderness between us and our nearest neighbor are
sufficient guard. But dream not, my lad, that we
are unobserved; doubtless fifty pair of skulking eyes
are even now upon us, marking every move. I venture
we travel no more than a hundred yards from the gate
before our way is barred. Note how peaceful the stockade
appears! But for the closed gates, one would never
dream it the centre of hostile attack. Upon my word,
even love-making has not deserted its log-walls!"</p>

<p>I lifted my eyes where he pointed, and even at
that distance, and through the gathering gloom, I
knew it was De Croix and Mademoiselle who overhung
those eastern palisades in proximity so close.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"> 206 </a></span>
The sight was as fire to my blood, and with teeth
clinched to keep back the mad utterance of a curse,
I strode beside Captain Heald silently down the declivity
to the deserted plain below.</p>

<p>It is my nature to be somewhat chary of speech,
and to feel deeply and long; but if I doubted it before,
I knew now, in this moment of keen and bitter disappointment,
that my heart was with that careless
girl up yonder, who had sent me forth into grave peril
apparently without thought, and who cared so little
even now that she never lifted her eyes from the sparkling
water to trace our onward progress. Anger, disappointment,
disgust at her duplicity, her cruel abuse
of power, swept over and mastered me at the moment
when I realized more deeply than ever my own love
for her, and my utter helplessness to oppose her slightest
whim. No Indian thongs could bind me half so
tightly as the false smiles of Toinette.</p>

<p>Plunged into this whirlpool of thought, I moved
steadily forward at Captain Heald's shoulder, unconscious
of what might be taking place about us, and for
the moment indifferent to the result of our venture.
But this feeling was not for long. Scarcely had our
progress taken us across the front of the deserted
agency building, and beyond the ken of the sentinels
in the Fort, when a single warrior rose before us as
from the ground, and blocked the path. He was a
short, sturdy savage, bare to the waist save for a chain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"> 207 </a></span>
of teeth which dangled with sinister gleam about his
brawny throat, and, from the wide sweep of his shoulders,
evidently possessed of prodigious strength. He
held a gun extended in front of him, and made a gesture
of warning impossible to misapprehend.</p>

<p>"What seeks the White Chief?" he questioned
bluntly. "Does he come for peace or war?"</p>

<p>The query came with such grave abruptness that
Heald hesitated in reply.</p>

<p>"Never since I have been at Dearborn have I
sought war," he replied at last. "Little Sauk knows
this well. We travel now that we may have council
of peace with the chiefs of the Pottawattomies. See!"
and he held up both empty hands before the Indian's
eyes, "we are both unarmed, because of our trust in
the good faith of your people."</p>

<p>Little Sauk uttered a low grunt of disapproval,
and made no motion to lower his threatening rifle.</p>

<p>"Ugh! You talk strong! Did any Pottawattomie
send to White Chief to come to council?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Heald. "We come because it
is the wish of the Great Father of the white men down
by the sea that we talk together of the wrongs of the
red men, and make proposals of peace between us.
There is no cause for these rumors of war, and the
Great Father has heard that the Pottawattomies are
dissatisfied, and it has made him sad."</p>

<p>The Indian looked from one to the other of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"> 208 </a></span>
in the growing darkness, and made a gesture of
contempt.</p>

<p>"The real Great White Father wears a red coat,
and is friend to the Pottawattomie," he said with
dignity. "He no lie, no shut Indian out of Fort, no
steal furs, no throw rum in river. Who this man,
White Chief? He no soldier,&mdash;he long-knife."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a frontiersman, and came to the Fort
yesterday with Wau-me-nuk, bringing word of greeting
from the Great Father to the Pottawattomies. He
goes now with me to council. May we pass on to your
camp?"</p>

<p>For a moment Little Sauk did not answer, stepping
closer in order that he might better scan my
features. Apparently satisfied by the keen scrutiny,
he turned his broad back upon us and strode off with
contemptuous dignity.</p>

<p>"Come," he said shortly; and without further
word we followed across that dim plain and through
the thickening darkness.</p>

<p>The Indian's step was noiseless, and his figure
cast the merest shadow; but as we moved onward
others constantly joined us, stalking out of the black
night like so many phantoms, gliding silently in their
noiseless moccasins across the soft grass, until fully
a dozen spectral forms hedged our pathway and kept
step to every movement. It was a weird procession,
through the shifting night-shadows; and although I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> 209 </a></span>
could catch but fleeting glimpses of those savage faces
and half-naked forms, the knowledge of their presence,
and our own helplessness if they proved treacherous,
caused my heart to throb till I could hear it in the
painful silence like the beat of a drum. Now and
then a guttural voice challenged from the darkness,
to be instantly answered by those in advance, and
another savage glided within our narrowed vision,
scanned us with cruel and curious eyes, and fell in
with the same silent, tiger-like tread of his fellows.</p>

<p>It was not long that we were compelled to march
thus, the gathering warriors pressing us closer at each
step; and it was well it proved so soon ended, for the
grim mockery set my nerves on edge. Yet the change
was hardly for the better. Just before reaching the
spot where the river forked sharply to the southward,
we came to the upper edge of the wigwams, and into
a bit of light from their scattered fires. There rushed
out upon us a wild horde of excited savages, warriors
and squaws, who pushed us about in sheer delirium,
and even struck viciously at us across the shoulders
of our indifferent guard, so that it was only by setting
my teeth that I held back from grappling with the
demons. But Heald, older in years and of cooler
blood, laid restraining hands upon my arm.</p>

<p>"'Tis but the riff-raff," he muttered warningly.
"The chiefs will hold them back from doing us serious
harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"> 210 </a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, Little Sauk uttered a gruff order, and
the grim warriors on our flank drove back the jeering,
scowling crowd, with fierce Indian cursing and blows
of their guns, until the way had been cleared for our
advance. We moved on for two hundred yards or
more, the maddened and vengeful mob menacing us
just beyond reach of the strong arms, and howling in
their anger until I doubted not their voices reached
the distant Fort.</p>

<p>We came to a great wigwam of deer-skin, much
larger than any I had ever seen, with many grotesque
figures of animals sketched in red and yellow paint
upon the outside, and clearly revealed by the blazing
fire without. A medicine-man of the tribe, hideous
with pigment and high upstanding hair, sat beating
a wooden drum before the entrance, and chanting
wildly to a ferocious-looking horde of naked savages,
many bleeding from self-inflicted wounds, who danced
around the blaze, the leaping figures in the red glare
making the scene truly demoniacal. Little Sauk strode
through the midst of them, unheeding the uproar, and
flung aside the flap of the tent.</p>

<p>"White Chief and Long Knife wait here," he said
sternly. "Come back pretty soon."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen within, excepting
some skins flung carelessly upon the short trodden
grass. We sat down silently upon these, gazing out
through the narrow opening at the blazing fire and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> 211 </a></span>
numerous moving figures constantly crowding closer
about the entrance, both of us too deeply immersed in
thought to care for speech.</p>

<p>The black shadows upon the tepee cover told me
that guards had been posted to keep back the rabble
from intrusion, and once I saw signs of a brief struggle
in front when the swarm had grown too inquisitive
and were forced back with scant ceremony. The weird
dance and incantation continued; and although I knew
but little of the customs of the Pottawattomies, there
was a cruel savagery and ferocity about it which I felt
held but little promise of peace.</p>

<p>"'Tis the war-dance," whispered Heald in my
ear, "and bodes ill for our purpose. See! the red
wampum is in the fellow's hand."</p>

<p>As I bent forward to catch the gleam of it in the
flames, a new figure suddenly flitted past our narrow
vista, between us and the wild circle of dancers. It
was a woman, attired in fanciful Indian dress; but
surely no Pottawattomie squaw ever possessed so
graceful a carriage, or bore so clear a face.</p>

<p>"Captain!" I ejaculated eagerly. "Did you see
that white woman there, with the long skirt and red
hair?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" he answered as though he scarce had
faith in his own eyes. "I marked not the color of
her hair, but I saw the lass, and, by Saint George!
she looked to me like old Roger Matherson's daughter."</p>

<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page212_i.png" width="178" height="179" alt="I " />
</span>&nbsp;WAS on my feet in an instant, forgetful of everything
excepting my duty to this
girl whom I had come so far
to find, and who now was
plainly a prisoner in Indian
hands. At the entrance of
the tepee, a scowling warrior
pushed me roughly back,
pretending not to understand my eager words of expostulation,
and, by significant gesture, threatening to
brain me with his gun-stock if I persisted. A slight
return of reason alone kept me from striking the
fellow down and striding over his prostrate body.
While I stood struggling with this temptation, Captain
Heald grasped me firmly.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, Wayland?" he muttered, dragging
me back into the dark interior of the tepee. "For
God's sake, don't anger these fellows! Think of all
the helpless lives depending on the success of our
errand here! What is the girl to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"> 213 </a></span></p>

<p>"I will wait," I answered, calmed by his earnestness,
and ashamed of my boyish impetuosity; "but
I am here at Dearborn seeking this young woman,
whom I had supposed rather to be a young child.
Her father was my father's dearest friend, and wrote
us from his death-bed asking our protection for her."</p>

<p>"You are Major Wayland's son,&mdash;I remember
the circumstances now, and that I endorsed such a
letter. 'Tis most strange. This girl disappeared from
Dearborn some days ago. Mrs. Heald heard the matter
discussed among the ladies of the garrison, and
then all supposed her to be at John Kinzie's in company
with Josette La Framboise; yet I would almost
have sworn I saw her again, and not two hours ago,
within the Fort. By Saint George! the glimpse I got
just now makes me doubt my own eyesight. She was
ever an odd creature,&mdash;but what can bring her here,
walking so freely about in this camp of vengeful
savages?"</p>

<p>I could not answer him; the mystery was beyond
my clearing. Only, if this was the Elsa Matherson
for whom I had sought so long, surely God had in
some way led me on to find her; nor should any peril
turn my quest aside.</p>

<p>I had hardly time for this resolve, ere the flap
of the tepee was held back by a dark hand, and
in grimly impressive silence warrior after warrior,
plumed, painted, and gaudily bedecked with savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"> 214 </a></span>
ornaments, stalked solemnly within, circled about us
without sign of greeting, and seated themselves cross-legged
upon the bare ground. The uplifted door-skin
permitted the red flames from without to play freely
over their stern, impassive faces, and shone back upon
us from their glittering eyes. It was an impressive
scene, their stoical demeanor breathing the deep solemnity
of the vast woods and plains amid which their
savage lives were passed; nor could one fail to feel
the deep gravity with which they gathered in this
council of life or death. To them it was evident that
the meeting was of most serious portent.</p>

<p>I saw only two faces that I recognized in that
red ring,&mdash;Topenebe and Little Sauk. I knew, however,
it was probable there were some great chiefs
among that company; and I marked especially two,
one with long white hair, and a tall, slender, rather
young fellow, having two wide streaks of yellow down
either cheek.</p>

<p>The Indians sat motionless, gazing intently at
us; and I swept the entire dark circle of scowling
faces, vainly endeavoring to find one hopeful glance,
one friendly eye. Open hatred, undisguised distrust,
implacable enmity, were stamped on every feature.
Whatever our plea might be, I felt convinced that
the chiefs were here only to carry out their own purposes
and make mock of every offering of peace.</p>

<p>After several moments of this painful silence, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"> 215 </a></span>
chief with the long white hair deliberately lighted a
large pipe drawn from his belt. It was curiously and
grotesquely fashioned, the huge bowl carved to resemble
the head of a bear. He drew from the stem a
single thick volume of smoke, breathed it out into the
air, and solemnly passed the pipe to the warrior seated
upon his right. With slow deliberation, the symbol
moved around the impassive and emotionless circle,
passing from one red hand to another, until it finally
came back to him who had first lighted it. Without
so much as a word being uttered, he gravely offered
it to Captain Heald. I heard, and understood, the
quick sigh of relief with which my companion grasped
it; he drew a breath of the tobacco, and I followed
his example, handing back the smoking pipe to the
white-haired chief without rising, amid the same impressive
silence.</p>

<p>The Indian leader spoke for the first time, his
voice deep and guttural.</p>

<p>"The Pottawattomies have met in council with
the White Chief and the Long Knife," he said soberly,
"and have smoked together the peace-pipe. For what
have the white men come to disturb Gomo and his
warriors?"</p>

<p>I gazed at him with new interest. No name of
savage chief was wider known along the border in
those days, none more justly feared by the settlers.
He was a tall, spare, austere man, his long coarse hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"> 216 </a></span>
whitened by years, but with no stoop in his figure.
His eyes, small and keen, blazed with a strange
ferocity, as I have seen those of wild-cats in the dark;
while his flesh was drawn so closely against his prominent
cheek-bones as to leave an impression of ghastliness,
as of a corpse suddenly returned by some
miracle to life. With dabs of paint across the forehead,
and thin lips drawn in a narrow line of cruelty,
his face formed a picture to be long remembered with
a shudder.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to see that Captain Heald
felt uncertain how far to venture in his proposals,
though he spoke up boldly, and with no tremor in his
voice. His long frontier experience had taught him
the danger that lay in exhibiting timidity in the face
of Indian scorn.</p>

<p>"Gomo," he said firmly, "and you other Chiefs
of the Pottawattomies, there has never been war between
us. We have traded together for many seasons;
you have eaten at my table, and I have rested by your
fires. We have been as brothers, and more than once
have I judged between you and those who would
wrong you. I have remembered all this, and have
now come into your camp through the night, without
fear and unarmed, that I might talk with you as
friends. Am I not right to do this? In all the time
I have been the White Chief at Dearborn, have I ever
done wrong to a Pottawattomie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"> 217 </a></span></p>

<p>He paused; but no warrior made reply. A low
guttural murmur ran around the line of listeners, but
the bead-like eyes never left his face. He went on:</p>

<p>"Why should I fear to meet the Pottawattomies,
even though word had come to me that their young
men talk war, and seek alliance with our enemy the
red-coats? The Chiefs have seen war, and are not
crazed for the blood of their friends. They will restrain
such wild mutterings. They know that the
White Father to the east is strong, and will drive the
red-coats back into the sea as he did when they fought
before. They will ally themselves with the strong one,
and make their foolish young man take up arms for
their friends."</p>

<p>Still no one spoke, no impassive bronze face exhibited
the faintest interest. It was as if he appealed
to stone.</p>

<p>"Is this not so?"</p>

<p>"The White Chief has spoken," was the cold
reply. "His words are full of eloquence, but Gomo
hears nothing that calls for answer. The White Chief
says not why he has come and demanded council of
the Pottawattomies."</p>

<p>A low murmur, expressive of approval, swept
down the observant line; but no man among them
stirred a muscle.</p>

<p>"I came for this, Gomo," said Heald, speaking
now rapidly, and with an evident determination to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"> 218 </a></span>
trust all in a sentence and have it over with, for it
was clear the savages were in no mood for diplomatic
evasion: "to ask your guidance and protection on our
march eastward on the morrow. I come to the Pottawattomies
as friends; for I fear we may meet with
trouble on the way, from roving bands of Wyandots
and Miamis, and we are greatly burdened by our
women and children. It is to ask this that I and the
Long Knife are here."</p>

<p>"You say the White Father is strong, and will
drive the red-coats into the sea: did he at Mackinac?"</p>

<p>"There was treachery there."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Why, if White Father so strong, you
leave Fort and go way off?"</p>

<p>"Because just now I can serve him better elsewhere;
but we shall come again."</p>

<p>"My young men have rumor that Detroit go like
Mackinac."</p>

<p>"It is untrue; your young men bring false news."</p>

<p>Gomo turned and looked about him upon the expectant
warriors; and, as if the glance was an invitation
to free speech, one sitting half-way across the
circle asked gruffly:</p>

<p>"Why you pour out rum, if you love Pottawattomie?"</p>

<p>"Because I am only the White Chief at Dearborn,"
returned Heald, facing the questioner, "and,
like Peesotum who asks, have higher chiefs elsewhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"> 219 </a></span>
whom I must obey. What they tell me I
have to do."</p>

<p>"White Chief lies!" was the short, stern answer.
"Winnemeg brought no such word."</p>

<p>So furious were the many dark, glowering faces,
that I braced myself, thinking the next moment would
be one of struggle for life or death; but Gomo held
them motionless with a wave of his hand. He rose
slowly to his feet, and faced us with grave dignity.</p>

<p>"It is true, as Peesotum says," he said impressively.
"The White Chief has used a double tongue
to the Red man; yet we will deal fairly with him,
for he has come to us in peace. White Chief, there
is to be war between us; 'tis the will of our young
men, and the red wampum has passed among our
lodges and the lodges of our brothers the Wyandots.
Yet when you unlock the gates we will go forth with
you and your people, around the sweep of the water.
Such is the will of the Great Spirit, and the decision
of the Pottawattomie in council of chiefs."</p>

<p>Heald looked about upon the scowling circle with
disbelief so clearly expressed in his eyes, that Gomo,
reading it, turned to his warriors and called upon them
one by one to say if he spoke the truth. I heard him
speak thus to Little Sauk, Black Bird, Topenebe,
Mankia, Pipe Bird, Peesotum, and Ignance; and each
answered with the low grunt of assent. He fixed his
eyes upon the younger Indian who had already attracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"> 220 </a></span>
my attention by the manliness of his face as
well as the yellow stripes that disfigured him.</p>

<p>"And you, Black Partridge?"</p>

<p>"I have already spoken to the White Chief in
his own wigwam, and given back the medal of the
Americans," was the grave response. "I have no
more to say."</p>

<p>I confess these words chilled me, as I recalled their
meaning; and Heald half rose to his feet as though
he would protest, but not a stolid face among the
warriors changed in expression. Gomo drew his robes
more closely about his gaunt figure in simple but impressive
dignity.</p>

<p>"Doth Shaw-nee-aw-kee go east also with the
white men?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have not of late conferred with the Silver-man.
He has been at his own lodge, and doubtless you may
know his purpose better than I."</p>

<p>"We wish him to stay. He good man; Pottawattomie's friend."</p>

<p>The Indian stood motionless, his eyes watching
keenly the expression of each face. He added slowly:</p>

<p>"The White Chief hears the promise of the Pottawattomies.
It is enough. He can go forth in peace
upon the morrow, with all his warriors, squaws, and
pappooses, and the people of my nation will walk with
them as guards. It is our pledge; we will counsel
no longer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"> 221 </a></span></p>

<p>At a simple commanding gesture of his long arms,
the circle melted away through the narrow opening
as silently as it had gathered, the dark figure of each
warrior silhouetted for an instant against the red glare
of the fire, before it suddenly disappeared in the darkness
beyond. At last Little Sauk alone stood between
us and the blaze.</p>

<p>"Come," he commanded gruffly, "White Chief
go back to his people."</p>

<p>Enclosed by that same phantom guard of savages,
we passed out through the limits of the camp; but
now the rabble paid not the slightest heed to our
presence. Our mission known, and no longer a mystery,
they treated us with the stolid indifference of
Indian contempt. I walked with eyes alert upon either
side of our path for another glimpse of that girlish
figure that I had seen before so dimly; but we traversed
nearly the full length of the tepee rows before
I saw any one that at all resembled her. Even then,
I was far from certain, until the sudden leaping up
of a dying fire reflected on her crown of auburn hair,
and set my heart to throbbing.</p>

<p>"Little Sauk!" I cried, in my excitement clutching
his naked arm, "who is that white girl yonder,
and how comes she here?"</p>

<p>The startled Indian sprang aside, flinging me
from him with a violence that showed his giant
strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"> 222 </a></span></p>

<p>"No white girl," he protested, vehemently. "Pottawattomie."</p>

<p>"No Pottawattomie has hair like the sunset," I
retorted. "Come, I would speak with the girl."</p>

<p>For an instant I saw the bead-like eyes of the
savage glittering in the darkness and wandering where
I pointed. He faced me doggedly.</p>

<p>"Long Knife leave Indian maid alone," he said
grimly. "Long Knife go Fort; no talk."</p>

<p>I was in a mood to resist the fellow's dictation,
and reckless enough of consequences at that moment
to take the chance; but Heald interfered.</p>

<p>"You can serve her far better, lad, in that way,"
he muttered hastily. "We shall not always be two
to twelve."</p>

<p>With teeth gritted to keep back the fierce anger
that shook me, I strolled sullenly on, not even venturing
to glance back lest I should give way. It was
thus we reached the Fort gate, and entered, leaving our
dusky escort to slink back into the night. An anxious
crowd met us. It was Wells who questioned first.</p>

<p>"So those devils have let you go unharmed?
What answer made the savages?"</p>

<p>"They pledge us safe convoy around the head
of the lake."</p>

<p>"They do? Who spoke the words of the pledge?"</p>

<p>"Old Gomo himself, and it was ratified by each
of the chiefs in turn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"> 223 </a></span></p>

<p>"They are lying dogs,&mdash;all but one of them.
What answered Black Partridge?"</p>

<p>Heald made no response; and Wells wheeled impetuously
to me.</p>

<p>"Come, lad, the truth,&mdash;what reply did Black
Partridge make to this Indian mummery?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'I have already spoken to the White
Chief in his own wigwam, and given back the medal
of the Americans, and have nothing more to say.'"</p>

<p>For a moment the old Indian soldier stared at
me, his stern face fairly black with the cloud in his
eyes. He brought his clinched hand down hard against
the log wall.</p>

<p>"By God! it is treachery!" he exclaimed fiercely,
and turned and walked away.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE LAST NIGHT AT DEARBORN</p>


<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page224_i.png" width="179" height="176" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T was evident that preparations were even then well
under way for retreat the
following morning. Trunks
and boxes, together with
various military stores and
arms, strewed the sides of
the parade-ground; farther
back, a number of wagons,
partially filled, stood waiting the remainder of their
loads. Men and women were hastening back and
forth, and children were darting through the shadows,
their little arms piled high with bundles, and making
play, as children ever will, of what was to prove an
awful tragedy. A large fire, burning brightly before
the deserted guard-house, cast its ruddy glow over the
animated scene, checkering the rude walls with every
passing shadow.</p>

<p>I noticed, as I slowly pushed my way along, that
the soldiers worked seriously, with few jests on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"> 225 </a></span>
lips, as if they realized the peril that menaced them;
while many among the women, especially those of the
humbler sort, were rejoicing over the early release
from garrison monotony, and careless of what the
morrow might bring of danger and suffering.</p>

<p>A few steps from the gate, I paused for a moment
that I might watch their flitting figures, the incessant
bustle being a positive relief after the dull and ghostly
silence without. My mind,&mdash;though I strove to cast
the thought aside,&mdash;was still occupied with the mystery
of Elsa Matherson; but the more I dwelt upon it,
the less I was able to penetrate the secret of her
strange presence in the Indian camp, or devise any
scheme for reaching her. The ache in my heart made
me dread to meet again with Mademoiselle Toinette,
lest I should utter words of reproach which she did
not deserve; for, sad as such a confession was, I had
to acknowledge that she had a perfect right to protect
the man she loved, even at my cost.</p>

<p>Nor did I greatly desire to run upon De Croix.
I knew his temper fairly well, and doubtless by this
time he had learned the story of my interference, and
would be in fit mood for a quarrel. Still, as seems
often to be the case at such a time, before I had taken
a dozen steps away from the gate, I met him face to
face. It was a jaunty picture he made in the glare
of the fire, the fine gentleman sauntering lazily about
with hat of bleached straw pushed rakishly upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"> 226 </a></span>
powdered hair, and a light cane dangling at his wrist,
as fashionably attired as if he were loitering upon the
boulevards of an August evening, his negro man a yard
behind, bearing a silken fan which flashed golden in
the radiance. At sight of him, I stopped instantly,
ready enough to resent attack if that had been his
purpose, though anxious to avoid violence for the sake
of Mademoiselle. But he merely laughed as he surveyed
me critically, swinging his bamboo stick as if
it were a whip-lash.</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>, Master Wayland!" he said, seeming
in rare good-humor, "I this moment learned of your
safe return. 'Twould have been an excellent joke had
the savage found excuse to retain you out yonder, to
form a part of one of their delightful entertainments!
Fit revenge, indeed, for the foul deceit you played
upon me!"</p>

<p>"Think you so, Monsieur?" for his easy words
relieved me greatly. "It would have been one less
arm for our defence."</p>

<p>"With safe convoy guaranteed by the Indian
chiefs, that loss would make small odds," he replied
carelessly. "But, truly, that was a most scurvy trick
you played to gain the wager which was offered me.
But for the happy ending, I should be sorely tempted
to break this cane across your shoulders in payment
therefor."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" I said; "the act might not be as easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"> 227 </a></span>
accomplished as you imagine. But what mean you by
happy ending? Had the savages roasted me over a
slow fire, I should hardly be here for the pleasure of
your chastisement."</p>

<p>He laughed lightly, his eyes wandering carelessly
over the throng of figures in front of us.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise! I thought not about your predicament,
but rather of the happiness which came
to me in the society of Mademoiselle. In faith, she
was most gracious with her favor. 'Tis thus you
did me a great kindness, friend, and have won my
gratitude."</p>

<p>The words were as stinging as he meant them to
be, for I marked his quick glance into my face. So I
held my resentment well in check, and smiled back at
him, apparently unconcerned.</p>

<p>"Then we are again even, Monsieur," I returned
quietly, "and can start anew upon our score. But why
should I remain here to discuss matters of such small
import, with all this work unfinished which fronts
strong men to-night? I will break my long fast, and
turn to beside these others."</p>

<p>He seemed to have further words to say; but I
minded him not, and pushed past, leaving him to
saunter where he willed, accompanied by his black
satellite. If I could not win Mademoiselle, as I now
felt assured from his boastful speech I could not, I
might at least work for her greater safety and comfort;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"> 228 </a></span>
and there was much I could do to help in burying my
own disappointment.</p>

<p>For all that, it was a night to live long in the
memory,&mdash;that last night we spent at Dearborn. It
remains a rare jumble in my mind,&mdash;its varied incidents
crowding so fast upon each other as to leave
small room for thought regarding any one of them.
Without, the dim black plain stretched away in unbroken
solemnity and silence; nor did the sentinels
posted along the walls catch glimpse of so much as
a skulking Indian form amid the grass and sand. A
half-moon was in the sky, with patches of cloud now
and then shadowing it, and in the intervals casting its
faint silver over the lonely expanse and tipping the
crest of the waves as they crept in upon the beach.
The great Indian village to the westward was fairly
ablaze with fires; while the unending procession of
black dots that flitted past them, together with the
echo of constant uproar, showed that the savages were
likewise astir in eager preparation for the morrow.
We could hear the pounding of wooden drums, mingled
with shrill yells that split the night-air like so many
war-missiles. Only those above, upon the platform,
could mind these things; for the bustle within the
enclosure below continued unabated until long after
midnight.</p>

<p>The report of our mission spread rapidly, and the
pledge of protection given by the chiefs greatly heartened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"> 229 </a></span>
the men, so that they worked now with many
a peal of laughter and careless jest. The women and
children, ever quick to feel the influence of the soldiers,
responded at once to this new feeling of confidence,
which was encouraged by the officers, however they
may have secretly doubted the good-faith of the savages.
So the children tumbled about in the red glare
of the flames, the soldiers swung their traps into the
waiting wagons with good-natured badinage, their
brawny breasts bare and glistening with sweat in the
hot night; while, as the hour grew late and discipline
sensibly relaxed, the women danced in the open and
sang songs of home.</p>

<p>It was hard enough to realize what it all meant,&mdash;what
hardship and suffering and death lay just before
these rejoicing people; what depths of cruel treachery
and murder lurked for them so few hours away. We
did not suspect it then; not even those among us who
had long learned the deceit of Indian nature could
unroll the shadowing veil of that morrow and reveal
the forthcoming tragedy of those silent plains. I remember
that, doubtful as I felt about the future, I
could look on with interest at the busy scene, and that
more than once a smile lay upon my lips. What an
odd variety of figures that congested place disclosed!
what strange life-histories were having their culmination
there! I saw Ensign Ronan, young, slender,
smooth of face, appearing scarce more than a boy, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"> 230 </a></span>
short fatigue-jacket buttoned to the throat in spite of
the heat, hurrying here and there in his enthusiasm,
ever upon his lips some happy phrase to take the sting
from his word of command. Lieutenant Helm, calm
but observant of every detail, moved in and out among
the busy throng, every now and then stealing aside
to speak a word of encouragement to his young wife,
who stood watching by the mess-room door. There
was quite a bevy gathered there, officers' wives for the
most part, gazing in mingled interest and apprehension
upon the scene. I marked among them Josette, who
had come in that evening with the Kinzies; and as I
drew yet nearer the group, a sudden blazing up of the
fire yielded me a glimpse of Mademoiselle, and I turned
hastily away, unwilling still to greet or be greeted by
her.</p>

<p>Gaunt frontiersmen stalked about, having little to
save and nothing to do, with the inevitable long rifle
held in the hollow of the arm; Captain Wells's Miamis
skulked uneasily in dark corners, or hung over the
embers to cook some ration yet unused, their dark
skins and long coarse hair a reminder to us of the hostiles
who watched without. Captain Heald, in company
with Captain Wells and John Kinzie, the latter
conspicuous by his white beard, stood long in deep
converse near the barracks, leaning against the black
logs. I felt the two latter were urging some change
of plan; but in the end Wells left in vexation, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"> 231 </a></span>
in anger, striding across the parade-ground to the
northern block-house.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the south stockade, some one
was softly playing upon a violin, the sweet notes stealing
up through the wild hubbub in strains of silvery
sound. Close upon one side of the fire, forgetful of
the heat in their deep interest, two young soldiers were
engrossed in a game of cards, while a group of comrades
commented freely on the fortunes of the play.
Scarcely a yard distant, a grizzled old sergeant,&mdash;a
veteran of the great war, no doubt,&mdash;bent above a
book held open upon his knee, the shape of which bespoke
a Bible; while on the other side a bevy of children
were romping with their dogs or playing with
sharp knives in the hard ground. A woman over by
the gate lifted a sweet contralto voice in an old-time
love-song, and had hardly lilted the opening line before
others joined her, making the night resound to the
tender melody. I saw the soldiers pause in their work
to beat time, and marked the dark forms of the sentries
above on the palisades as they leaned over to listen,
every heart set throbbing with the memory of days
gone by.</p>

<p>"Man is indeed a strange animal," said a voice
beside me, and I turned to greet Ensign Ronan. "He
can sing, laugh, and jest, in death's very teeth."</p>

<p>"'Tis better, surely, than to cry," I commented.
"But these do not so much as dream of death; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"> 232 </a></span>
pledge of the Pottawattomies has brought renewed
hope."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; though I confess I have little
faith in it. And there will be plenty of danger about
us before we see Fort Wayne, even if they pass us in
safety around the lake. There will be leagues of travel
through hostile territory. That," he added, "is, to my
mind, the only sensible way of preparation for the
morrow."</p>

<p>He pointed to the old sergeant seated beside the
fire with his Bible; and I glanced into his boyish face
with no little surprise.</p>

<p>"Some remark Surgeon Van Voorhis made caused
me to deem you indifferent in such matters."</p>

<p>"No doubt," he said, dryly. "If one does not
subscribe to the creeds, he is written down a heretic.
I have laughed at folly, and so have won the reputation
of being an unbeliever. Yet, Wayland, if we ride
forth to a savage death to-morrow, no one will meet it
with more faith in Christ than I. The years indeed
have not left me spotless, but I have never wavered
from the great truths my mother taught me. I know
not the future, lad, but I believe there is ever mercy
for the penitent."</p>

<p>In an instant my own thought spanned the leagues
of forest to my distant home; and I choked back a sob
within my throat.</p>

<p>"It is our mothers' love that makes us all better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"> 233 </a></span>
men," I said gravely. "And whatever may befall us
upon the morrow, that God of whom they taught us
will be true."</p>

<p>"The words are spoken in the right spirit," he returned,
soberly, "and have the soldier ring I like best
to hear. If it chance that we both come forth from
this venture in life, I should be most glad to know
you better."</p>

<p>I was deeply touched by his open, manly spirit,
and especially impressed with his frank adherence to
the Christian faith, something too uncommon in
that day along the border.</p>

<p>"'Tis rather my wish to begin friendship before
that time of trial," I said eagerly, and with extended
hand. "We shall fight the better for it when the hour
for fighting comes; and if it be God's will to guide us
safely through the wilderness, a friendship thus cemented
in peril will have the strength of comradeship."</p>

<p>The young man's strong and thoughtful face
lighted up; but his eyes were resting upon the form
of the sentry above us, and he did not speak.</p>

<p>"Ronan," I questioned, somewhat doubtfully, "I
have long wished to ask you the cause of the friction
that apparently exists between Captain Heald and the
officers of this garrison; but have felt it none of my
business. I cannot but realize you are not in his good
graces, although he appears to me to be a brave and
capable man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"> 234 </a></span></p>

<p>"He is both," was the instant and manly reply;
"for all that, he has constantly turned for counsel in
military matters to others than his own officers,&mdash;why,
I know not, unless he considered us unworthy of
his confidence. Instead of confiding his orders to us,
and asking judgment upon his plans, he has been
swayed from the beginning by Indian advice; and it
is only natural for us to resent such unjust and discourteous
treatment. Moreover, each move thus far
made has proved to be a mistake, and we must suffer
from them in silence and without remedy."</p>

<p>"He does indeed seem strangely headstrong," I
admitted reluctantly, recalling to mind the words
uttered in the room beyond my bed; "but surely his
conference with the chiefs has resulted well, and is
proof of his good judgment."</p>

<p>The young officer turned quickly and faced me,
his eyes full of emotion. "That remains to be decided,"
he exclaimed. "Such old frontiersmen as
Captain Wells and John Kinzie say that pledge only
hides black treachery. They urged him most earnestly,
for an hour to-night, to reconsider his decision, and
give up the immediate evacuation of the post. But he
fully believes he can put faith in those lying, murderous
hounds out yonder. So certain is Kinzie of
trouble, that he has sworn to march forth with us,
sending his family away by boat, in hope that his
influence may hold back the savages from open attack;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"> 235 </a></span>
while Wells declares that he will ride forth with blackened
face, as becomes a Miami who goes to certain
death in battle. These men are no fools, no strangers
to savage warfare and Indian deceit,&mdash;yet in spite of
their warning, Captain Heald persists in driving us
forth into the very fangs of the wolves. Brave! ay,
he is indeed brave to the point of rashness; but this
bids fair to be a fatal bravery to all of us who must
obey his orders."</p>

<p>The intense bitterness of these words shocked me
and held me dumb,&mdash;the more so, as I could not be
insensible to their truth. As I lifted my eyes, I beheld,
crossing the parade through the mass of equipment
scattered here and there, De Croix and Mademoiselle.
With a half-muttered excuse, I drew hastily back into
the protecting shadow of the stockade; and as they
slowly passed, I heard him jesting lightly, and saw her
laughing, with a side-glance up at his face.</p>

<p>With these words of warning from Ronan's lips
yet ringing in my ears, such reckless thoughtlessness
of the danger encircling us astounded me; and I drew
farther back, less willing than ever to make one of
them. Deep in my heart, I knew this was no time for
careless laughter or happy jest.</p>

<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page236_i.png" width="182" height="180" alt="I" />
</span><span class="hidden">I</span>T was after midnight when
I finally ceased my labors,
feeling I had performed my
fair share of the hard work
of preparation. By this
time everything was comparatively quiet within the
stockade enclosure; the wagons were piled with all that
could be loaded before morning, and many of the wearied
soldiers had flung themselves upon the ground to
snatch what rest they might before the early call to
march. The women and children had disappeared,
to seek such comfort as was possible amid the ruins
of their former quarters; and only the sentries remained
alert, pacing their solemn rounds on the narrow
walk overlooking the palisades and the silent plain
without.</p>

<p>Physically wearied as I was, my mind remained
intensely active, and I felt no desire for sleep. I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"> 237 </a></span>
recall that I gave much thought to the perils of our
situation. One grows careless and indifferent to danger,&mdash;and
in truth I looked forward to no serious
trouble with the Indians upon the morrow's march
through the sand-dunes; not that I greatly trusted to
those reluctant pledges wrung from the chiefs, but
because I felt that if properly handled in that open
country our force was of sufficient fighting strength
to repel any ordinary attack from ill-armed savages,
my long border experience rendering me a bit disdainful
of Indian courage and resourcefulness. So it was
that my restless mind dwelt rather upon other matters
more directly personal. I could not put away the
thought of the half-seen girl flitting about amid the
dusk of the Pottawattomie camp, especially as Captain
Heald had declared her to be Elsa Matherson. I was
surprised to discover that she I sought, instead of
being a mere child, was a woman grown; for in this
we were all deceived by the words of her father.
What did she there, passing with such apparent freedom
from restraint among those fierce warriors? and
how was I ever to reach her with any hope of rescue,
even if she desired it? There was evidently a mystery
here which I could never solve through idle musing;
and yet I could but ask myself where lay my graver
duty,&mdash;beside this single woman, who seemingly
needed no defender, or with the many helpless ones
who must march forth on the morrow on that long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"> 238 </a></span>
dangerous passage through the wilderness? Indeed,
what hope could I cherish of aiding the young girl,
if I now deserted these others, and endeavored alone
to penetrate that Indian camp in search of her?</p>

<p>Then came another thought. It was of Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>It was this that effectually halted me. To whomsoever
else she might have given her heart, she was
still the one for whom I was most glad either to live
or die; and in spite of De Croix, I would ride at
her side on the morrow, within striking distance
of any prowling hostile. Let the Matherson girl
wait; my arm belonged first of all to the defence of
Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>Busied with these thoughts, and endeavoring to
adjust this decision with my conscience, I passed out
upon the platform, that I might look forth once more
upon the moonlit waters of the lake. There were a
few dim figures to be seen, leaning over the logs; but
I supposed them to be members of the night-guard,
and, feeling no desire for companionship, I halted in
a lonely spot at the northeastern corner of the stockade.
How desolate, how solemnly impressive, was the
scene! To the north all was black in the dense night,
the shadows of the scattering trees obscuring the faint
glow of the moon and yielding little of detail to the
searching eye. Even the single ray of light which the
evening previous had blazed forth as a friendly beacon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"> 239 </a></span>
from the Kinzie home, was now absent. I could
vaguely distinguish the dim outlines of the deserted
house in the distance, and noticed a large boat moored
close to the bank beneath the Fort stockade, doubtless
the one in which the fugitives expected to venture
out upon the lake on the morrow.</p>

<p>It was the wide stretch of water, gleaming like
silver, that fascinated me, as it always did in its numberless
changing moods. What unutterable loneliness
spoke to the soul in those unknown leagues of tossing
sea! how far the eye wandered unchecked, searching
vainly for aught to rest upon other than glistening
surge or darkling hollow! The mystery of the ages
lay unexpressed in those tossing billows, sweeping
in out of the black east, making low moan to the unsympathetic
and unheeding sky. Deeper and deeper
the spirit of unrest, of doubt, of brooding discontent,
weighed down upon me as I gazed; life seemed as aimless
as that constant turmoil yonder, a mere silver-tinted
heaving, destined to burst in useless power on
a shore of rock, and then roll back again into the
mighty deep.</p>

<p>I leaned over the palisades, sunk deep in revery
of home, recalling one by one the strange incidents of
the last month that had so curiously conspired to cause
a total upheaval of my life; and for the moment I
grew oblivious of my surroundings. A mere lad,
knowing little of himself and less of life, had ridden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"> 240 </a></span>
westward from the Maumee; a man, in thought and
character, leaned now over that beleaguered stockade
of Dearborn.</p>

<p>I was recalled to actualities by a light touch on
the sleeve of my shirt, and a half-laughing, half-petulant
voice at my elbow.</p>

<p>"Well, Master Laggard! do I not show you great
honor in thus seeking you out, after your avoidance
of me all these hours?"</p>

<p>I glanced aside into the fair face and questioning
eyes, noting at the same time that De Croix stood only
a step beyond her in the shadows.</p>

<p>"I have been very busy, Mademoiselle," I tried
to explain; "it has been a time when every strong
hand was needed."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" was the indignant rejoinder. "Did I
not perceive you loitering more than once to-night,&mdash;though
each time I drew near, hopeful of a word of
greeting, it was to behold you disappear as if by
magic? Do I flatter you by thus showing my interest?
Yet 'twas only that I might have explanation, that
I sought you thus. Come, confess that you feared my
just resentment for going forth on so perilous a trip
without telling me of your plans."</p>

<p>"'Twas not altogether that," I answered, for dissembling
was never an easy task for me, "as I only did
what I believed would most please you. Nor have I
anything to regret in my action, now that we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"> 241 </a></span>
thus gained the pledge of the Pottawattomies for protection
upon the march."</p>

<p>She watched me closely as I spoke, and I wondered
if she realized ever so dimly the impulse of loving
service that had inspired my deed. Whether 'twas
so or not, her whole mood quickly changed.</p>

<p>"I must admit you are a constant puzzle to me,
John Wayland, yet rather an interesting one withal.
For instance, here is Josette, who did assure me but
an hour ago that your very name was unknown to
her, although, if memory serves, you asserted only
yesterday that you were seeking her from the
Maumee country. Perhaps, sir, you can explain the
contradiction?"</p>

<p>"It was not altogether as you have stated it,
Mademoiselle," I stammered, confused by the directness
of her attack. "I said nothing of knowing this
Josette, and you have deceived yourself in the matter.
I came here seeking a young girl, 'tis true, but found
no trace of her until a few hours ago, most curiously,
in the heart of that Indian camp yonder."</p>

<p>"You found her there? How strange!"</p>

<p>"Most strange indeed, Mademoiselle, especially
as she appeared to enjoy perfect liberty among the
savages."</p>

<p>"You spoke with her?"</p>

<p>"Not a word; it was only a glimpse I caught of
her in the firelight, and when I sought to go to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"> 242 </a></span>
the warriors interfered and forced me back. But Captain
Heald, who saw her at the same time, assured me
'twas the one I sought."</p>

<p>"'Tis small wonder, then, you could stand here
at my very side so long, and yet see me not, or remain
indifferent to my presence," she said, drawing slightly
back. "Come, Captain de Croix, let us walk to the
other corner of the stockade, and leave Master Wayland
to dream of his mysterious beauty undisturbed."</p>

<p>"You misapprehend me," I cried, awakened by
her words, but more by De Croix's smile. "She has
no such hold upon my memory as that, for until to-night
I had supposed her a mere child. I knew not
you were upon the platform, believing the forms I saw
in the gloom to be those of the night-guard. What
dark figure is that, even now leaning over the logs
yonder?"</p>

<p>It was De Croix's deeper voice that made answer.</p>

<p>"'Tis Captain Wells; and we found him in no
mood for conversation. Seemingly he hath small faith
in the pledges of the chiefs."</p>

<p>"My own hope rests far more upon our skill at
arms, Monsieur," I answered directly; "for I have
known Indian treachery all my life. They may keep
faith with us to-morrow, for John Kinzie has great
influence with them for good; nevertheless, I shall
oil my gun carefully before riding forth."</p>

<p>It was in his eyes to make reply; but before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"> 243 </a></span>
it could come the girl between us uttered a cry so
piercing that it set us gazing where her finger pointed
out across the lake.</p>

<p>"Look there, Messieurs! Did ever mortal behold
so grewsome a sight before? What means the
portent?"</p>

<p>It is before me now, in each grim, uncanny detail,&mdash;though
I know well that my pen will fail to give
it fit description, or convey even feebly a sense of the
overwhelming dread of what we saw. Nature has
power to paint what human hand may never hope to
copy; and though, as I now know well, it was no more
than a strange commingling of cloud and moon in
atmospheric illusion, still the effect was awe-inspiring
to a degree difficult of realization within the environments
of peace and safety. To us, it appeared as a
dreadful warning,&mdash;a mysterious manifestation of
supernatural power, chilling our blood with terror and
striking agony into our souls. Up from the far east
had rolled an immense black cloud, rifted here and
there by bars of vivid yellow as electric bolts tore it
asunder. Moonlight tipped its heavy edges with a pale
spectral gleam; and as it swiftly rose higher and
higher into the sky, blotting out the stars, it seemed
to dominate the entire expanse, hovering over us menacingly,
and assuming the shape of some gigantic
monster, with leering face and cruel mouth, bending
forward as if to smite us with huge uplifted hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"> 244 </a></span>
Perchance our tensioned nerves may have exaggerated
the resemblance, but nothing more horribly real have
my eyes ever beheld.</p>

<p>For a moment I cowered, like a nerveless craven,
behind the logs, gazing up at that awful apparition,
that mocking devil's-face, as a man fronts death in
some terrible and unexpected form. It seemed as if
the breath of the creature must be pestilence, and that
it would smite us gasping to earth, or draw us helplessly
struggling within its merciless clutch. A prayer
trembled on my lips, but remained unuttered, for I
could only stare upward at the mighty, crawling thing
now overshadowing us, my arms uplifted in impotent
effort to avert the crushing blow.</p>

<p>I could hear the girl sob where she had sunk upon
the platform, and caught one glimpse of De Croix,
his face yellow in the weird glare as he stared in
speechless terror out over the water, his hands clutching
the palisades. It was Captain Wells, who had
been standing near us, who first found voice.</p>

<p>"Tis the Death-Shadow of the Miamis!" he
cried, in choked accents, striding toward us along the
narrow plank, and pointing eastward. "I knew it
must come, for our doom is sealed."</p>

<p>What centuries of Indian superstition rested behind
the fateful utterance, I know not; but facing
that horrible spectre as we did, his words held me in
speechless awe. In the blood of us all such terrors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"> 245 </a></span>
linger to unman the bravest; and for the moment such
fright and panic swept me as I have never known
before or since. I, who have laughed at death even
in the hour of torture, sank in deadly agony before
that mystery of light and shadow, as if it indeed foreshadowed
the wrath of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>The sobs of Mademoiselle recalled me somewhat
to myself, and led me to forget my own terror that
I might help to relieve hers.</p>

<p>"I beg you, fear not," I urged, though my voice
trembled and my lips were dry. "Come, Mademoiselle,"
and I found her hand and clasped it, feeling the
touch a positive relief to my unstrung nerves, "look
up and see! the cloud is even now breaking asunder,
and has already lost much of its form of terror. Mind
not the words of Captain Wells; he has been raised
among the Indians, and drunk in their superstitions.
De Croix, arouse yourself, and help me to bring
courage to this girl."</p>

<p>He drew back from his grip on the palisades, as
if, by sheer power of will, he forced his fascinated eyes
from the cloud-bank, shivering like a man with an
ague fit.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacre!</i> did ever human eyes behold so foul a
thing!" he cried, his voice shaking, his hand shading
his face. "'Twill haunt me till the hour I die."</p>

<p>"Bah! 'Twill all be forgotten with return of
daylight," I was quick to reply; for had found relief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"> 246 </a></span>
in action, and could perceive already that the clouds
were becoming shapeless and drifting rapidly southward
in a great billowy mass. "Do not stand there
moping like a day-blind owl, but aid me to make Mademoiselle
see the foolishness of her fears."</p>

<p>The sting of these words moved him more than
a blow would have done; but as he knelt beside her,
I noted there was little of the old reckless ring in his
voice.</p>

<p>"'Tis indeed true, Toinette,&mdash;'twas but a cloud,
and has already greatly changed in aspect. 'Twill be
no more than cause for laughter when the sun gilds
the plain, and will form a rare tale to tell to the gallants
at Montreal. Yet, Saint Guise! 'twas grewsome
enough, and my knees quake still from the terror of
the thing."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was as brave and cool-headed a girl
as ever I knew; but so thoroughly had she been unnerved
by this dreadful happening, that it was only
after the most persistent urging on our part that she
consented to be led below. There, at the foot of the
ladder, I stepped aside to permit De Croix to walk with
her across the parade; but she would not go without
a word of parting.</p>

<p>"Do not think me weak and silly," she implored,
her face, still white from the terror, upturned to me
in the moonlight. "It was so spectral and ghastly
that I gave way to sudden fear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"> 247 </a></span></p>

<p>"You need no excuse," I hastened to assure her.
"When the thing frightened De Croix and me, and
even set so old a soldier as Captain Wells to raving,
it was no wonder it unnerved a girl, however brave
she might prove in the presence of real danger. But
you can sleep now, convinced it was naught but a
floating cloud."</p>

<p>She smiled at me over her shoulder, and I watched
the pair with jealous eyes until they disappeared. I
noticed Captain Wells standing beside me.</p>

<p>"You thought I raved up yonder," he said gravely;
"to-morrow will prove that my interpretation of the
vision was correct."</p>

<p>"You believe it a prophecy of evil?"</p>

<p>"It was the warning of the Great Spirit&mdash;the
Death-Shadow of the Miamis. Never has it appeared
to men of our tribe except on the eve of great disaster,
the forerunner of grave tragedy. We ride forth from
these gates to death."</p>

<p>It was plain that no amount of reasoning could
change his Indian superstition; and with a word more
of expostulation I left him standing there, and sought
a place where I might lie down. Already the numbing
sensation of supernatural fear had left me, for in the
breaking up of that odd-formed cloud I realized its
cause; and now the physical fatigue I felt overmastered
all else. I found a quiet corner, and, with a
saddle for a pillow, was soon fast asleep.</p>

My hand trembles and my
pen halts as I write the
words; for the memory of
those tragic hours, far distant as they are now, over
masters me, and I see once
again the faces of the dead,
the mutilated forms, the disfigured
features of the hapless victims of savage
treachery. Were I writing romance merely, I might
hide much of detail behind the veil of silence; but I am
penning history, and, black as the record is, I can only
give it with strict adherence to truth. I dread the
effort to recall once more the sad incidents of that
scene of carnage, lest I fail to picture it aright; but
I can tell, and that poorly, only of what I saw within
the narrowed vista of my personal experience, where
the fate of the day found me. Out of the vortex of
so fierce and sudden a struggle, the individual, battling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"> 249 </a></span>
madly for his own life, catches but hasty and confused
glimpses of what others may do about him or in other
portions of the field; and there has been much recorded
in what men call the history of that day's battle,
about which I know nothing. Nor shall I attempt to
tell much more than the simple story of what befell
me and those who faced the danger close at my side.</p>

<p>In spite of the early bustle around me, incident
to the preparations for departure, I slept late, stupefied
by intense fatigue. The sun was already high, painting
with gold the interior of the western wall of the
stockade, when some unusual disturbance aroused me,
so that I sat up and looked about, scarce realizing for
the moment where I was. The parade was alive with
moving figures; and I instantly marked the cheery
look on the faces of those nearest me, as if the entire
garrison rejoiced that the hour for departure had at
last arrived. The northern half of the little open space
was filled with loaded wagons of every description,
to which horses, mules, and even oxen, were being
rapidly hitched; while women and children were
clambering in over the wheels, perching themselves
upon the heaps of camp accoutrements, and rolling up
the canvas coverings in order that they might the
better see out and feel the soft refreshment of the
morning air.</p>

<p>The officers of the post were moving here and
there among the throng of workers, grave of face, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"> 250 </a></span>
making no effort to curb the unusual gaiety of the enlisted
men. For the time, all reins of discipline seemed
relaxed. The few settlers and plainsmen who had
gathered within the Fort for protection looked on
stolidly, either lying in the shade of the log wall or
lounging beside their horses already equipped for the
trail; while the Miamis were gathered restlessly about
their breakfast fires, their faces unexpressive of emotion,
as usual, although many among them had blackened
their cheeks in expectation of disaster.</p>

<p>Evidently the hour fixed upon for our final desertion
of Fort Dearborn was close at hand; and I hastened
to seek opportunity for a bath and breakfast. I
do not recall now, looking back after all these years
upon the events of that day, any dreading of the future,
or serious thought of the coming ordeal. The bustle
of excitement about me, the high spirits of the men,
were like a tonic; and I remembered only that we
were east-bound once more, and my chief concern was
to be ready to ride out promptly with the column.</p>

<p>It could not have been far from nine o'clock when
every preparation was completed, and the echoing
bugle called the laggards from their quarters into the
open parade. The officers, already mounted, rode
about quietly, assigning each driver and wagon to position
in the marching column, and carefully mustering
the troops. The many sick of the garrison were
brought forth from the barracks in their blankets, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"> 251 </a></span>
gently lifted to places beside the women and children
in the loaded wagons; while the men fit for active duty
fell in promptly along the southern wall, the right of
their slender column resting opposite the barred entrance.
I was assigned to ride with the rear-guard
beside the wagons, in company with the few settlers
and fifteen of the Miamis under command of Sergeant
Jordan. Captains Heald and Wells, the latter with
face blackened so that at first glance I scarcely recognized
him, took position at the head of the waiting
column in front of the closed gates, and they sat there
on their horses, facing us, and watching anxiously our
rather slow formation.</p>

<p>John Kinzie joined them, his features grave and
careworn, a long rifle in his hands; while the ladies
of the garrison, plainly dressed for the long and hard
journey, came forth from their several quarters and
were assisted to mount the horses reserved for them.
De Croix accompanied Mademoiselle, attired as for a
gay pleasure-ride in the park, and gave her his gloved
hand to step from into the saddle, with all the gallantry
he might have shown a queen. I knew this was no
boy's play before us now; and, crushing back my
natural diffidence, I spurred my horse boldly forward
until we ranged up beside her, even venturing to uncover
in polite salute.</p>

<p>Never did I see her look fairer than beneath the
shade of the wide-brimmed hat she had donned to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"> 252 </a></span>
the hot sun from her clear cheeks; nor was there the
slightest vestige of last night's terror lurking in the
laughing eyes that flashed me greeting.</p>

<p>"I surely know of one sad heart amid this gay
company," she exclaimed, "for while we rejoice at
being once more bound for civilization, Master Wayland
looks most truly mournful; doubtless his thought
is with her who has turned Indian for a time."</p>

<p>Her careless bantering tone nettled me; but I was
quick enough to answer, having no wish to awaken
her fears as to the safety of our journey.</p>

<p>"'Tis true, Mademoiselle. I dislike greatly to
leave in peril one I have journeyed so far to seek; nor
can I banish from my mind the thought that perhaps
I am failing in my duty toward her. Yet surely you
have small cause for complaint, as I have, instead,
deliberately chosen to ride here at your side, in order
that I may be near to defend you should occasion arise,&mdash;provided
always that my presence shall meet your
wishes and approval."</p>

<p>She bowed as best she could in her high-peaked
saddle, shooting a mischievous glance from me to
the unconcerned and self-satisfied face of the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"I am indeed most gratified and happy, Monsieur,
thus to feel myself the object of such devotion;
but I greatly fear you will prove but a poor companion
on the journey if you wear so glum a look. Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"> 253 </a></span>
de Croix is full of wit and good-humor this morning,
and has already cheered me greatly with reminiscences
of happier days."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" I said, looking at the fellow curiously.
"He has quickly forgotten the baleful portent of last
night. I thought the daylight would yield him new
heart."</p>

<p>"And why not? 'Twas but a cloud, as all of us
know now,&mdash;though I confess it terrified me greatly
at the time. You yourself seem not even yet to have
wholly shaken off its terror."</p>

<p>"'Tis not the supernatural that so troubles me,"
I rejoined. "As you may perceive yonder, Captain
Wells rides forth with blackened face to what he
deems to be certain death. I acknowledge, Mademoiselle,
that I look forward to a serious clash of arms
before we are rid of the redskins, in spite of their
pledges; and shall therefore keep close beside you,
hopeful that my arm may show you better service than
my tongue before nightfall."</p>

<p>Her eyes had grown grave as she listened; for
I spoke with soberness, and there crept into them a
look that thrilled me. Before either could speak again,
Ensign Ronan rode up beside me.</p>

<p>"Wayland," he questioned anxiously, "what is
this I hear about a strange portent in the eastern sky
last night? Saw you anything terrifying there?"</p>

<p>"'Twas no more serious than a cloud which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"> 254 </a></span>
chanced to assume the form of a monster, and its
aspect was most terrifying until we understood the
nature of its formation. Then it became merely an
odd memory to weave a tale about. Mademoiselle
here saw it, and remains in most excellent spirits
nevertheless."</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to her, and stared hard at De
Croix, who barely nodded to his greeting.</p>

<p>"By Heavens!" he exclaimed, as if much relieved,
"it seemed to me as if Nature had conspired with those
red demons yonder to sap our courage, when first I
heard the rumor. I am so convinced that there is
trouble afoot, that my nerves are all a-tingle at such
mystery."</p>

<p>"Are the savages gathering without?"</p>

<p>"Ay! they are in mass of hundreds, awaiting us
at the foot of the mound, and have been since daybreak.
See! the sentries are being called down, and
the men are at the gate levers. I must be back at my
post."</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and I clasped it warmly,
feeling my heart go out instantly to the brave, impetuous lad.</p>

<p>"You ride this day with the rear-guard," he said,
lingering as if loath to go, "and my duty lies with the
van. We may not chance to meet again, but the God
we spoke about together last night will strengthen our
hearts to meet their duty. It matters not where men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"> 255 </a></span>
die, but how. Good-bye, Mademoiselle! Captain de
Croix, I wish you a most pleasant journey."</p>

<p>With doffed hat, he struck spurs into his nettle-some
horse, and was gone; while the ringing notes of
the bugle called the waiting column to attention.</p>

<p>I watched with deepening interest all that was
taking place before me. The heavy log-gates were
unbarred, swung slowly inward, and left unguarded.
Captain Heald uttered a single stern word of command,
and Captain Wells, with a squad of his Miamis
pressing hard at his horse's heels, rode slowly through
the opening out into the flood of sunshine. Captain
Heald and Mr. Kinzie, side by side, with Mrs. Heald
mounted upon a spirited bay horse a yard in their rear,
followed close; and then to Lieutenant Helm's grave
order the sturdy column of infantrymen, heavily
equipped and marching in column of fours, swept in
solemn curve about the post of the gate, and filed out
through the narrow entrance. The regular tramp-tramp,
the evident discipline, and the confident look
of the men, impressed me. While I was watching
them, the small garrison band began suddenly to play,
and the smiling soldier faces clouded as they glanced
around in questioning surprise.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise!" ejaculated De Croix, uneasily;
"it is the Dead March!"</p>

<p>I marked the sudden look of terrified astonishment
in Mademoiselle's eyes, and dropped my hand upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"> 256 </a></span>
hers where it rested against the saddle-pommel. Ensign
Ronan spurred swiftly back down the column,
with an angry face, and hushed the ill sound by a
sharp order.</p>

<p>"Another tune, you fool, or none at all!" he said,
peremptorily. "The foul fiend himself must have
assumed charge of our march to-day."</p>

<p>As the column marched away, the groaning
wagons one by one fell into line behind it, until at last
our own turn came, and De Croix and I, each with
a hand upon the bridle-rein of Mademoiselle's spirited
horse, rode between the gate-posts out to where we
had full view of that stirring scene below.</p>

<p>It was a fair, bright morning, with hardly so much
as a fleecy white cloud in all the expanse of sky; glorious
sunlight was flashing its prismatic colors over
a lake surface barely ruffled by the faintest breeze.
Never did Nature smile more brightly back into my
eyes than then, as I gazed out over the broad plain
where the glow of the summer reflected back in shimmering
waves from the tawny prairie and glittering
sand. With all its desolation, it was a picture to be
treasured long; nor has a single detail of it ever left
my memory.</p>

<p>How vast the distances appeared through that
clear, sun-illumined atmosphere, and how pronounced
and distinctive were the varied colors spread to the
full vista of the eye, contrasts of shine and shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"> 257 </a></span>
no human brush, however daring, would venture
to depict on canvas. A primitive land this, idealized
by distance, vast in its wide, sweeping plains,
its boundless sea, its leagues of glistening sand,
and, bending over all, the deepest, darkest arch
of blue that ever mirrored so fair a picture of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Scattered groups of cottonwood trees, the irregular
mounds and ridges of sand, the silvery ribbon of
river, merely emphasized the whole, and gave new
meaning to what might else have been but sheer desert
waste. I knew little then of what other years had
seen within these solitudes and within the circle of my
view; yet scraps of border legend came floating back
into memory, until I recalled the name of many an old-time
adventurer,&mdash;La Salle, Joliet, Marquette the
Jesuit,&mdash;who must have camped beside that very
stream out yonder.</p>

<p>The column had halted as our last laggards cleared
the gate; and for a moment we rested in silence upon
the side of the slope, while the long line was being
re-arranged for travel. The Indians, in seemingly disorganized
masses, were already enveloping the head
of the column with noisy clamor, and Wells was having
difficulty in holding his Miami scouts to their
proper position. A few scattered and skulking savages,&mdash;chiefly
squaws, I thought at the time,&mdash;were
stealthily edging their way up the slope of the slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"> 258 </a></span>
rise, eager to begin the spoliation of the Fort as soon
as we had deserted it.</p>

<p>Wild and turbulent as was the scene, I perceived
no alarming symptoms of hostility, and turned toward
Mademoiselle with lighter heart. Her dark eyes were
full of suppressed merriment as they encountered mine.</p>

<p>"I thought you would sit there and dream all
day," she said pleasantly; "and I hardly have the
heart to blame you. 'Tis indeed a fair scene, and one
I almost regret leaving, now that the time to do so has
come. Never before has its rare beauty so strongly
appealed to me."</p>

<p>"'Tis the great distance outspread yonder which
renders all so soft to the eye," I answered, glad to
reflect her mood; "yet Captain de Croix and I know
well 'tis far less pleasant travelling over than to look
at here. We think of the swamps, the forests, the
leagues of sand and the swift rivers which will hinder
our progress."</p>

<p>"I hardly imagine," she murmured softly, "that
Captain de Croix is guilty of wasting precious time in
reflection upon aught so trivial this morning. He has
been conversing with me upon the proper cut of his
waistcoat, and I am sure he is too deeply engrossed
in that subject to give heed to other things."</p>

<p>I glanced at him and smiled as my heart glowed
to her gentle sarcasm, for surely never did a more
incongruous figure take saddle on a western trail. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"> 259 </a></span>
what code of fashion he may have dressed, I know
not; but from his slender-pointed bronze shoes to his
beribboned hat he was still the dandy of the boulevards,
his dark mustaches curled upward till their tips
nearly touched his ears, and a delicately carved riding-whip
swinging idly at his wrist. He seemed to have
already exhausted his powers of conversation, for he
remained oblivious of our presence, fumbling with one
yellow-gloved hand in the recesses of a saddle-bag.</p>

<p>"By Saint Denis, Sam!" he exclaimed, angrily,
to his black satellite, "I can find nothing of the
powder-puff, or the bag of essence! <i>Parbleu!</i> if they
have been left behind you will go back after them,
though every Indian in this Illinois country stand
between. Come, you imp of darkness, know you aught
of these?"</p>

<p>"Dey am wid de pack-hoss, Massa de Croix," was
the oily answer. "I done s'posed you wouldn't need
'em till we got thar."</p>

<p>"Need them! Little you know the requirements
of a gentleman! Saint Guise! Why, I shall want
them both this very day! Ride you forward there, and
see if they cannot be picked out from among the other
things."</p>

<p>"See, Monsieur!" cried Mademoiselle suddenly,
one hand pressing my arm, while she pointed eagerly
with the other, "there goes the boat with Mistress
Kinzie and her children! That must be Josette in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"> 260 </a></span>
bow, with the gay streamer about her hat. She did
wish so to ride with us, but Mr. Kinzie would not
permit it."</p>

<p>The boat had but just cleared the river-mouth,
and was working off-shore, with half a dozen Indians
laboring at the oars.</p>

<p>"Yet Josette has by far the easiest passage, as we
shall learn before night," said I, watching their progress
curiously. "I imagine you will soon be wishing
you were with them."</p>

<p>"Never, Master Wayland!" she cried, with a
little shudder, and quick uplifting of hands to her face
as if to shut out the sight. "Memory of the hours
when I was last on the lake is still too vivid. I have
grown to dread the water as if it were an evil spirit.
See! the column resumes its march, and the savages
are moving beside us as might a guard of honor."</p>

<p>It was as she had said. The long, hard journey
had begun; and slowly, like some great snake torpid
with a winter's sleep, the crawling column drew forward.
We at the rear rode down the incline and out
upon the level plain, every step an unconscious advance
toward battle and death.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">W</span>E chatted carelessly about
many things, as we rode
slowly onward, our unguided horses following
those in advance along the
well-marked trail close beside the water along the
sandy beach. Mademoiselle
was full of life and bubbling
over with good-humor; while De Croix, having found
the essentials of his toilet safe, grew witty and light
of speech, even interesting me now and then in the idle
words that floated to my ears,&mdash;for he managed to
monopolize the attention of the young girl so thoroughly
that after a little time I sat silent in my saddle,
scarce adding a word to their gay tilt, my eyes and
thought upon the changing scene ahead.</p>

<p>I know not why, as I reflect calmly upon the
incidents of that morning, I should have grown so
confident that the savages meant us fair; yet this feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"> 262 </a></span>
steadily took possession of me, and I even began to
regret that I had not stayed behind in quest of her
for whom I had come so far. Surely it was hopeless
for me to dangle longer beside Mademoiselle, for De
Croix knew so well the little ins and outs of social
intercourse that I was like a child for his play. Moreover,
it was clear enough that the girl liked him, or
he would never presume so to monopolize her attention.
That she saw through much of his vain pretence,
was indeed probable; her words had conveyed this
to me. Nevertheless, it was plain she found him entertaining;
he was like a glittering jewel in that rough
wilderness, and I was too dull of brain and narrow of
experience to hope for success against him in a struggle
for the favor of a girl so fair and gay as this
Toinette.</p>

<p>I thought the matter all out as I rode on through
the sunlight, my eyes upon the painted savages who
trooped along upon our right in such stolid silence
and seeming indifference, my ears open to the light
badinage and idle compliments of my two companions.
Yes, it would be better so. When the Indians left the
column at the head of the lake, I would invent some
excuse that might allow me to accompany them on
their return, and I would remain in the neighborhood
of the Fort until Elsa Matherson had been found.</p>

<p>Just in front of us, a large army wain struggled
along through the yielding sand, drawn by a yoke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"> 263 </a></span>
lumbering oxen. The heavy canvas cover had been
pushed high up in front, and I could see a number of
women and children seated upon the bedding piled
within, and looking with curious interest at the stream
of Indians plodding moodily beside the wheels. Some
of the little tots' faces captivated me with their expression
of wide-eyed wonder, and I rode forward to
speak with them; for love of children is always in
my heart.</p>

<p>As I turned my horse to draw back beside Mademoiselle,
my eyes rested upon the stockade of the old
Fort, now some little distance in our rear; and to my
surprise it already swarmed with savages. Not less
than five hundred Indians,&mdash;warriors, all of them, and
well armed,&mdash;tramped as guards beside our long and
scattered column, yet hundreds of others were even
now overrunning the mound and pouring in at the
Fort gates, eager for plunder. I could hear their
shouting, their fierce yells of exultation, while the
grim and silent fellows who accompanied us never so
much as glanced around, although I caught here and
there the glint of a cruel, crafty eye. The sight made
me wonder; and I swung my long rifle out from the
straps at my back down across the pommel of my
saddle, more ready to my hand.</p>

<p>The trail we had been following now swerved
nearer the lake, deflected somewhat by a long high
ridge of beaten sand, separating the shore from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"> 264 </a></span>
prairie. Here the two advancing lines of white and
red diverged, the Indians moving around to the western
side of the sand-ridge, while Captain Wells and his
Miami scouts continued their march along the beach.
There was nothing about this movement to awaken
suspicion of treachery, for the beach at this point had
narrowed too much for so great a number moving
abreast, and it was therefore only natural that our
allies should seek a wider space for their marching,
knowing they could easily reunite with us a mile or
so below, where the beach broadened again. Their
passing thus from our sight was a positive relief; and
so quiet did everything become, except for groaning
wheels and the heavy tread of horses, that Mademoiselle
glanced up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, what has become of the Indians?" she
questioned. "Have they already left us?"</p>

<p>I pointed to the intervening sand-ridge.</p>

<p>"They move parallel with us, but prefer to walk
upon the prairie-grass rather than these beach pebbles.
For my part, I would willingly dispense with their
guard altogether; for in my judgment we are of
sufficient strength to defend ourselves."</p>

<p>"Ay, strong enough against savages," interposed
De Croix, his eyes upon the straggling line ahead;
"yet if by any chance treachery was intended, surely
I never saw military formation less adapted for repelling
sudden attack. Mark how those fellows march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"> 265 </a></span>
out yonder!&mdash;all in a bunch, and with not so much
as a corporal's guard to protect the wagons!"</p>

<p>I was no soldier then, and knew little of military
formation; but his criticism seemed just, and I ventured
not upon answering it. Indeed, at that very
moment some confusion far in front, where Captain
Wells led his scouts, attracted my attention. We
must have been a mile and a half from the Fort by
this time, and I recalled to memory the little group
of trees standing beside the trail where we had halted
on our journey westward to enjoy our earliest glimpse
of Dearborn. At first I could make out little of what
was taking place ahead; then suddenly I saw the
squad of Miamis break hastily, like a cloud swept by
a whirling wind, and the next instant could clearly
distinguish Captain Wells riding swiftly back toward
the column of infantry, his head bare, and one arm
gesticulating wildly. In a moment the whole line
came to a startled and wondering pause.</p>

<p>"What is it?" questioned Mademoiselle anxiously,
shading her eyes. "Have the Indians attacked us?"</p>

<p>"God knows!" I exclaimed, clinching my rifle
firmly. "But it must be,&mdash;look there!"</p>

<p>Wheeling rapidly into line, as if at command,
although we could hear no sound of the order, the
soldiers poured one quick volley into the sand-ridge
on their right, and then, with a cheer which floated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"> 266 </a></span>
faintly back to us, made a wild rush for the summit.
This was all I saw of the struggle in front,&mdash;for,
with a cry of dismay, the Miamis composing the rear-guard
broke from their posts beside the wagons and
came running back past us in a panic of wild terror.
I saw Sergeant Jordan throw himself across their line
of flight, striking fiercely with his gun, and cursing
them for a pack of cowardly hounds; but he was
thrown helplessly aside in their blind rush for safety.</p>

<p>"Wayland! De Croix!" he shouted, staggering
to his knees, "help me stop these curs, if you would
save our lives!"</p>

<p>It was a fool thing, yet in the excitement I did
it, and De Croix was beside me. Two or three of the
settlers on foot rallied with us, and together we struck
so hard against those cowering renegades that for the
moment we held them, though their fear gave them
desperation difficult to withstand. I recall noticing
De Croix, as he pressed his rearing horse into the
huddled mass, lashing at the faces of the fellows mercilessly
with his riding-whip, as if thinking Mademoiselle
would admire his reckless gallantry.</p>

<p>A wild yell, with the mad thrill of the war-whoop
in it, suddenly assailed our ears; the Miamis broke
to the left like a flock of frightened birds, and my
startled glance revealed a horde of naked Indians,
howling like maniacs, and with madly brandished
weapons, pouring over the sand-ridge not thirty feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"> 267 </a></span>
away from us. With a shout of warning, which was
half a curse at my own mad folly, I drove the spurs
deep into my horse's side in a vain endeavor to fling
myself between them and the girl. Hardly had the
startled animal made one quick plunge, when we were
locked in that human avalanche as if gripped by a vise
of steel. A dozen dark hands grasped my bridle or
clutched at me, their swarthy faces fierce with blood-lust,
the eyes that fronted me cruel with passion and
inflamed by hate. I heard shots not far away; but we
were all too closely jammed to do more than fight in a
desperate hand-to-hand struggle with club and knife.</p>

<p>The saddle is a poor place from which to swing
a rifle, yet I stood high in my wooden stirrups and
struck madly at every Indian head I saw, battering
their faces till from the very horror of it they gave
slowly back. I won a yard&mdash;two yards&mdash;three,&mdash;my
horse biting viciously at their naked flesh, and
lashing out with both fore-feet like a fiend, while I
swept my gun-stock in a widening circle of death.
For the moment, I dreamed we might drive them back;
but then those devils blocked me, clinging to my
horse's legs in their death agony, and laughing back
into my face as I struck them down.</p>

<p>Once I heard De Croix swearing in French beside
me, and glanced around through the mad turmoil
to see him cutting and hacking with broken blade,
pushing into the midst of the <i>mle</i> as if he had real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"> 268 </a></span>
joy in the encounter. While I thus had him in view,
a knife whistled through the air, there was a quick
dazzle in the sunlight, and he reeled backward off his
horse and disappeared in the ruck below.</p>

<p>Never in a life of fighting have I battled as I
did then, feeling that I alone might hope to reach her
side and beat back these foul fiends till help should
come to us. The stock of my rifle shattered like glass;
but I swung the iron barrel with what seemed to me
the strength of twenty men, striking, thrusting, stabbing,
my teeth set, my eyes blurring with a mist of
blood, caring for nothing except to hit and kill. I
know not now whether I advanced at all in that last
effort, though my horse trod on dead bodies. Only
once in those awful seconds did I gain a glimpse of
Mademoiselle through the mist of struggle, the maze
of uplifted arms and striking steel. She had reined
her horse back against a wheel of the halted wagon,
and with white face and burning eyes was lashing
desperately with the loaded butt of her riding-whip
at the red hands which sought to drag her from the
saddle.</p>

<p>The sight maddened me, and again my spurs were
driven into my horse's flanks. As he plunged forward,
some one from behind struck me a crushing blow
across the back of the head, and I reeled from my
saddle, a red mist over my eyes, and went hurling face
downward upon the mass of reeling, tangled bodies.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>HE fierce plunging of my
horse in his death agony,
and his final pitching forward
across my prostrate
body, were doubtless all
that saved my life. Yielding to their mad desire for
plunder, the savages scattered when I fell, and left
me lying there for dead. I do not think I quite lost
consciousness in those first moments, although everything
became blurred to my sight, and I was imprisoned
by the weight above me so that the slightest
effort to move proved painful; indeed, I breathed only
with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>But I both heard and saw, and my mind was
intensely occupied with the rush of thought, the horror
of all that was going on about me. How I wish I
might blot it out,&mdash;forget forever the hellish deeds
of those dancing devils who made mock of human
agony and laughed at tears and prayers! It was plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"> 270 </a></span>
as the wild cries of rejoicing rose on every side, that
the Indians had swept the field. The distant sound
of firing ceased, and I could hear the pitiful cries of
women, the frightened shrieks of children, the shrill
note of intense agony wrung from tortured lips. Close
beside me lay a dead warrior, his hideously painted
face, with its wide, glaring, dead eyes, so fronting me
that I had left only a narrow space through which
to peer. Within that small opening I saw murder done
until I closed my eyes in shuddering horror, crazed
by my own sense of helplessness, and feeling the
awful fate that must already have befallen her I loved.
God knows I had then no faintest wish to live;
nor did I dream that I should see the sun go down
that day. Death was upon every side of me, in its
most dreadful forms; and every cry that reached my
ears, every sight that met my eyes, only added to the
frightful reality of my own helplessness. The inert
weight of the horse stifled me so that I drew my
short breath almost in sobs; nor did I dare venture
upon the slightest attempt at release, hemmed about
as I was by merciless fiends now hideously drunk with
slaughter. Once I heard a man plead for mercy,
shrieking the words forth as if his intensity of agony
had robbed him of all manliness; I saw a young
woman fall headlong, the haft of a tomahawk cleaving
open her head, as a brawny red arm gripped her by
the throat; a child, with long yellow hair, and face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"> 271 </a></span>
distorted by terror, ran past my narrow outlook, a
naked savage grasping after her scarcely a foot behind.
I heard her wild scream of despair and his
shout of triumph as he struck her down. Then I lost
consciousness, overwhelmed by the multiplying horrors
of that field of blood.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell how long I lay there, or by what
miracle of God's great mercy I had escaped death and
mutilation. It was still day, the sun was high in the
heaven, and the heat almost intolerable, beating down
upon the dry and glittering sand. I could distinguish
no sound near at hand, not even a moan of any kind.
The human forms about me were stiffening in death;
nor did any skulking Indian figures appear in sight.</p>

<p>From away to the northward I could hear the
echo of distant yelling; and as I lay there, every
faculty alert, I became more and more convinced that
the savages who had attacked us had withdrawn, and
that I alone of all that fated company was preserved,
through some strange dispensation of Providence, for
what might prove a more terrible fate than any on
that stricken field. With this thought there was suddenly
born within me a fresh desire for life, a mad
thirsting after revenge on those red demons whose
merciless work I had been compelled to see. Yet if
I hoped to preserve my life, I must have water and
air; a single hour longer in my present situation could
only result in death. Fortunately, such relief, now that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"> 272 </a></span>
I felt free to exert myself and seek it, was not so
difficult as it had seemed. The heavy horse rested
upon other bodies as well as my own, so that, little by
little, I succeeded in dragging myself out from beneath
his weight, until I was finally able to lift my head and
glance cautiously about me.</p>

<p>I pause now as I sit writing, my face buried in my
hands, at the memory of that dreadful field of death.
I cannot picture it, nor have I wish to try. I took
one swift glimpse at the riven skulls, the mangled
limbs, the mutilated bodies, the upturned pleading
faces white and ghastly in the sunlight, the women
and children huddled in heaps of slain, the seemingly
endless line of disfigured, half-stripped bodies stretching
far down the white beach; then I fell upon my
face in the sand, sobbing like a baby. O God, how
could such deeds be done? How could creatures
shaped like men prove themselves such fiends, such
hideous devils of malignity? It sickened me with
horror, and I shrank from those dead bodies as if
each had been a grim and threatening ghost.</p>

<p>Necessity presently overcame the dread possessing
me; and slowly, seeking to see no more than I must
of the awful scenes about me, I struggled to my knees,
and peered around cautiously for signs of skulking
Indians. Not a living creature was near enough to
observe me. To the northward the savages were
swarming about the Fort, and it was evident that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"> 273 </a></span>
had left everything to search for plunder. My uncovered
head throbbed under the hot sun, and my hair
was thick with clotted blood; scarce a hundred feet
away was the blue lake, and on my hands and knees
I crawled across the beach to it, forgetful of everything
else in my desire to roll in the cool sweet water.</p>

<p>I realized that it would be far safer for me to
remain there until darkness shrouded my movements;
but I felt so revived by the touch of the water that the
old desire for action overcame considerations of personal
safety. Before night came I must somehow gain
possession of a rifle, with powder and ball; and I must
discover, if possible, the fate of Mademoiselle. I cannot
describe how, like a frightened child, I shrank
from going again amid those mutilated corpses. I
started twice, only to crawl back into the water, nerveless
and shaking like the leaf of a cottonwood. I knew
it must be done, and that the sooner I attempted it
the safer would be the trial; so at last, with set teeth
and almost superhuman effort, I crept up the beach
among the silent, disfigured dead once more.</p>

<p>With little trouble I found the wagon against
which I had seen Mademoiselle draw back her horse
in that last desperate defence. It was overturned,
scorched with flame, its contents widely scattered;
while about it lay the bodies of men, women, and
children. A single hasty glance at most of these was
sufficient; but a few were so huddled and hidden that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"> 274 </a></span>
I was compelled to move them before I thoroughly
convinced myself that Mademoiselle was not there. I
finally found her horse, several rods away, lying against
the sand-ridge; but she whose body I sought with such
fond persistency was not among those mangled forms.
Faint and sick from the awful scene, with head
throbbing painfully, I sank down upon a slope of sand
where I was able to command a clear view in either
direction, and thought rapidly. I was alone with the
dead. Of all those lying silent before me, none would
stir again. Not a savage roamed the stricken field,&mdash;though
doubtless they would again swarm down upon
it as soon as the sacking of the Fort had been completed.
I must plan, and plan quickly, if I would
preserve my own life and be of service to others. And
life was worth preserving now, for there was a possibility,&mdash;faint,
to be sure, yet a possibility,&mdash;that
Toinette still lived. How the mere hope thrilled and
animated me! how like a trumpet-sound it called to
action! She had told me once of friendships between
her and these blood-stained warriors; of weeks passed
in Indian camps on the great plains, both with her
father and alone; of being called the White Queen
in the lodges of Sacs, Wyandots, and Pottawattomies.
Perchance some such friendship may have intervened
to save her, even in that fierce <i>mle</i>, that carnival of
lust and murder. Some chief, with sufficient power to
dare the deed, may have snatched her from out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"> 275 </a></span>
jaws of death, actuated by motives of mercy,&mdash;or,
more likely still, have saved her from the stroke of the
tomahawk for a far more terrible fate.</p>

<p>This was the thought that brought me again to
my feet with burning face and tightly clinched teeth.
If she lived, a helpless prisoner in those black lodges
yonder, there was work to be done,&mdash;stern, desperate
work, that would require all my courage and resourcefulness.
Firm in manly resolve, and rendered reckless
now of contact with the dead, I crept back among the
bodies in eager search for gun and ammunition. For
a long time I sought vainly; the field had been stripped
by many a vandal hand. At last, however, I turned
over a painted giant of a savage whose head had been
crushed with a blow, and beneath him discovered a
long rifle with powder-horn half filled. As I drew it
forth, uttering a cry of delight at my precious find,
my eyes fell upon a pair of bronze boots, with long
narrow toes, protruding from beneath a tangled mass
of the slain. It was no doubt the tomb of De Croix;
and without so much as a thought that he could be
alive, I drew the bodies off him and dragged his form
forth into the sunlight.</p>

<p>Merciful Heaven! his heart still beat,&mdash;so faintly,
indeed, that I could barely note it with my ear
at his chest. But life was surely there, and with
a hasty glance about to assure me that I was unobserved,
I ran to the lake shore. I returned with hat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"> 276 </a></span>
full of water, with which I thoroughly drenched him,
rubbing his numbed hands fiercely, and thumping his
chest until at last the closed eyes partially opened, and
he looked up into my anxious face, gasping painfully
for breath. His lips moved as I lifted his head in my
arms; and I bent lower, not certain but he was dying
and had some last message he would whisper in my ear.</p>

<p>"Wayland," he faltered feebly, "is this you?
Lord, how my head aches! Send Sam to me with the
hand-mirror and the perfumed soap."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I answered, almost angry at his flippant
utterance. "Sam is no doubt dead, and you and I
alone are spared of all the company. Do you suffer
greatly? Think you it would be possible to walk?"</p>

<p>"I have much pain here in the side," he said
slowly, "and am yet weak from loss of blood. All
dead, you say? Is Toinette dead?"</p>

<p>"I know not, but I have not found her body
among the others, and believe her to be a prisoner
to the savages. But, come, De Croix," I urged, anxiously,
"we run great risk loitering here; there is
but one safe spot for us until after dark,&mdash;yonder,
crouched in the waters of the lake. The Indians may
return at any moment to complete their foul work;
and for us to be found alive means torture,&mdash;most
likely the stake, and will remove the last hope for
Mademoiselle. Think you it can be made if you lean
hard on me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"> 277 </a></span></p>

<p><i>"Sacre!</i> 'twill not be because I do not try, Master
Wayland," he answered, his voice stronger now that
he could breathe more freely, and with much of his
old audacity returned. "Help me to make the start,
friend, for every joint in my body seems rusty."</p>

<p>His face was white and drawn from agony, and
he pressed one hand upon his side, while perspiration
stood in beads upon his forehead. But no moan came
from his set lips; and when he rested a moment on
his knees, looking about him upon the dead, a look
of grim approval swept into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise, Wayland," he said soberly, "'twas
a master fight, and the savages had it not all their
own way!"</p>

<p>It made me sick to hear such boasting amidst the
horror that yet overwhelmed me, and I drew the fellow
up to his feet with but little tenderness.</p>

<p>"God knows 'tis sad enough!" I answered,
shortly. "Come, there are parties of Indians already
straying this way from the Fort yonder, and it behooves
us to get in hiding."</p>

<p>He made the distance between us and the water
with far less difficulty than I had expected, and with
a better use of his limbs at each step. In spite of
vigorous protest on his part, I forced him out from the
shore until the water entirely covered us, save only
our faces; and there we waited for the merciful coming
of the night.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>HE touch of the water
brought renewed life to De
Croix. This was shown by
the brighter color stealing
into his cheeks, as well as
by the more careless tone
that crept into his voice.
The lake proved shallow for
some considerable distance
off shore, and I compelled the Frenchman to wade with
me southward, and as far out as we dared venture,
until we must have reached the extreme limit of the
field of massacre. Indeed, I fully believed we had
passed beyond the point where the attack had first
burst upon Captain Wells's Miamis; for I could perceive
no sign of any bodies lying opposite us against
the white background of sand. As the night drew
on, squads of savages wandered over the scene of
slaughter, despoiling the stiffening corpses, and taking
from the wagons whatever might suit their fancy. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"> 279 </a></span>
we were now so far removed that we could distinguish
little of their deeds, although the sound of their voices
echoed plainly enough across the water to our ears.</p>

<p>As time passed, the numbness that had paralyzed
my brain, either from the cruel blow that felled me
or the terrible shock my nerves had experienced, gradually
passed away, and our situation became more
vivid to my mind. I thought again of all who had gone
forth that morning filled with hope and life. I had,
it is true, known none of them long, but there were
many in that ill-fated company who had already grown
dear to me, and one was among them who I now
knew beyond all question was to remain in my heart
forever.</p>

<p>I recalled the faces one by one, with some tender
memory for each in turn. I thought of the brave
Captain Wells, with his swarthy face, and Indian training,
who had proved himself so truly my friend for
my father's sake; of Captain Heald, the typical bluff
soldier of the border, ready to sacrifice everything to
what he deemed his duty; of Lieutenant Helm, grave
of face and calm of speech, always so thoughtful of
his sweet girl bride; and of young Ronan, loyal of
heart and impetuous of deed, whose frank manliness
had so drawn me to him. And now all these brave,
true comrades were dead! Only five or six hours ago
I had spoken with them, had ridden by their side; now
they lay motionless yonder, stricken down by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"> 280 </a></span>
basest treachery, their poor bodies hacked and mutilated
almost beyond recognition. I could scarcely realize
the awful truth; it rested upon me like some horrible
dream, from which I knew I must soon awaken.</p>

<p>But it was Mademoiselle,&mdash;Toinette, with the
laughing eyes and roguish face, which yet could be so
tender,&mdash;whose memory held me vibrating between
constant dread and hope. Living or dead, I must
know the truth concerning her, before I felt the slightest
consideration for my own preservation. If I lived,
it should be for her sake, not mine. Plan after plan
came to me as I stood there, my face barely raised
above the water level, praying for the westering sun to
sink beneath the horizon. Yet all my plans were so
vague, so visionary, so filled with difficulties and uncertainties,
that at last I had nothing practical outlined
beyond a firm determination in some way to reach
the Indian camp and there learn what I could of its
black secrets. I wondered whether this rash hare-brained
Frenchman would aid or hinder such a purpose;
and I glanced aside at him, curious to test the
working of his mind in such a time of trial.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise!" he exclaimed, marking my look,
but misinterpreting it; "the sun has gone down at
last, and there seems a chill in the air where it strikes
my wet skin. It is in my thought to wade ashore,
Master Wayland, and seek food for our journey, as
I can perceive no savages near at hand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"> 281 </a></span></p>

<p>"It will be safer if we wait here another half-hour,"
I answered, almost inclined to smile at the
queer figure he cut, with his long, wet hair hanging
down his shoulders. Then I added, "What journey
do you contemplate?"</p>

<p>He gazed at me, his face full of undisguised
amazement.</p>

<p>"What journey? Why, Mon Dieu! to the eastward,
of course! Surely you have no wish to linger
in this pleasant spot?"</p>

<p>"And is that the way of a French soldier?" I
asked, almost angrily. "I thought you made the
journey westward, Monsieur, for the sake of one you
professed greatly to admire; and now you confess
yourself willing to leave her here to the mercy of these
red wolves. Is this the way of it?"</p>

<p>I spoke the words coolly, and they cut him to the
quick. His face flushed and his eyes flashed with
anger; yet I faced him quietly, though I doubt not
I should have felt his hand upon me had we been
better circumstanced for struggle.</p>

<p>"How know you she lives?" he asked sullenly,
eying the rifle I still held across my shoulder.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Monsieur, except that her body
is not upon the field yonder; but I will know before
I leave, or give my life in the search. And if you
really loved her as you professed to do, you would
dream of nothing less."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"> 282 </a></span></p>

<p>"Love her?" he echoed, his gaze upon the sand,
now partially obscured in the descending twilight.
<i>"Sacre!</i> I truly thought I did, for the girl certainly
has beauty and wit, and wove a spell about me in
Montreal. But she has become as a wild bird out
here, and is a most perplexing vixen, laughing at my
protestations, so that indeed I hardly know whether it
would be worth the risk to stay."</p>

<p>Hateful and selfish as these words sounded, and
much as I longed to strike the lips that uttered them
so coolly, yet their utterance brought a comfort to my
heart, and I stared at the fellow, biting my tongue to
keep back the words of disgust I felt.</p>

<p>"So this is the measure of your French gallantry,
Monsieur! I am sincerely glad my race holds a different
conception of the term. Then you will leave me
here?"</p>

<p>"Leave you? <i>Sacre!</i> how could I ever hope to
find my way alone through the wilderness? 'Twould
be impossible. Yet why should we stay here? What
can you and I hope to accomplish in so mad a search
amid all these savages? You speak harsh words,&mdash;words
that under other conditions I should make you
answer for with the sword; but what is the good of it
all? You know I am no coward; I can fight if there
be need; yet to my mind no help can reach Toinette
through us, while to remain here longer is no less than
suicide."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"> 283 </a></span></p>

<p>I saw he was in earnest, and I felt there was much
truth in his words, however little they affected my own
determination.</p>

<p>"As you please, Monsieur," I answered coldly,
turning from him and slowly wading ashore. "With
me 'tis not matter for argument. I seek Mademoiselle.
You are at perfect liberty either to accompany me or
to hunt for safety elsewhere, as you wish."</p>

<p>I never so much as glanced behind, as I went up
the beach, now shrouded in the swift-descending night;
but I was aware that he kept but a step behind me.
Once I heard him swear; but there was no more speaking
between us, until, in the darkness, I stumbled and
partially fell over a dead body outstretched upon the
sand.</p>

<p>"A Miami, judging from the fringe of his leggings,"
I said briefly, from my knees. "One of the
advance guard, no doubt, brought down in flight. 'Tis
good luck, though, De Croix, for the fellow has retained
his rifle. Perchance if you be well armed also,
it may yield you fresh courage."</p>

<p><i>"Parbleu!</i> 'tis not courage I lack," he returned,
with something of his old-time spirit, "but I hate
greatly to yield up a chance for life on so mad an
errand. More, Master Wayland, had this firearm
been in my hands when you flouted me in the water
yonder, your words should not have been so easily
passed over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"> 284 </a></span></p>

<p>The stars gave me a dim view of him, and there
was a look in his face that caused me to feel it would
be best to have our trouble settled fully, and without
delay.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," I said sternly, laying my hand upon
his shoulder, and compelling him to front me fairly,
"I for one am going into danger where I shall require
every resource in order to preserve my life and be of
service to others. I have already told you that I care
not whether you accompany me or no. But this I say:
we part here, or else you journey with me willingly,
and with no more veiled threats or side looks of
treachery."</p>

<p>"I meant no harm."</p>

<p>"Then act the part of a man, Monsieur, and cease
your grumbling. The very life of Mademoiselle may
hang upon our venture; and if you ever interfere or
obstruct my purpose, I will kill you as I would a dog.
You understand that, Monsieur de Croix; now, will
you go or stay?"</p>

<p>He looked about him into the lonely, desolate
shadows, and I could see him shrug his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I go with you, of course. <i>Sacre!</i> but I have
small choice in the matter; 'twould be certain death
otherwise, for I know not east from west in this blind
waste of sand."</p>

<p>I turned abruptly from him, and strode forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"> 285 </a></span>
across the sand-ridge out into the short prairie-grass
beyond, shaping my course westward by the stars.
However revengeful the Frenchman might feel at my
plain speaking, I felt no hesitancy in trusting him to
follow, as his life depended upon my guidance through
the wilderness.</p>

<p>My mind by this time was fairly settled upon our
first movement. The only spot that gave promise of
a safe survey of the Indian camp, where doubtless
such prisoners as there were would be held, I felt sure
would be found amid the shadows of the west bank
of that southerly stream along which the lodges were
set up. From that vantage point, if from any, I should
be able to judge how best to proceed on the perilous
mission of rescue.</p>

<p>While we were feeling our way forward through
the darkness, a great burst of flame soared high into
the northern sky, the red light radiating far abroad
over the prairie, until even our creeping figures cast
faint shadows on the level plain.</p>

<p>"Saint Guise! They have set fire to the Fort!"
exclaimed De Croix, halting and gazing anxiously
northward.</p>

<p>"Ay, either to that or to the agency building,"
I answered. "It was not there I expected to find the
prisoners, but rather hidden among those black lodges
yonder whence all the shouting comes. 'Tis torture,
De Croix, which has so aroused those devils; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"> 286 </a></span>
will soon enough prove our turn to entertain them, if
we linger long within this glare."</p>

<p>"You have a plan, then?"</p>

<p>"Only a partial one at present,&mdash;'tis to put the
safeguard of the river between us and those yelling
fiends. Beyond that it will all be the guidance of
God."</p>

<p>The stream proved to be a narrow one, and the
current was not swift. We crossed it easily enough,
without wetting our stock of powder, and found the
western bank somewhat darkened by the numerous
groups of small stunted trees that lined it. I moved
with extreme caution now, for each step brought us
in closer proximity to those infuriated tribesmen who
were holding mad carnival in the midst of their lodges.
I felt sure that our pathway along the western shore
was clear, for the most astute chief among them would
hardly look for the approach of enemies from that
quarter; but I was enough of a frontiersman not to
neglect any ordinary precautions, and so we crept like
snakes along at the water's edge, under the shadow
of the bank, until much of the wild scene in the village
opposite was revealed to our searching eyes.</p>

<p>It was a mad saturnalia, half light, half shadow,
amid which the fierce figures of the painted warriors
passed and repassed in drunken frenzy, making night
hideous with savage clamor and frenzied gesticulations.
I would have crept on farther, seeking a place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"> 287 </a></span>
for crossing unobserved, had not De Croix suddenly
grasped me by the leg. As I turned, the play of the
flames from across the water struck upon his white
face, and I could read thereon a terror that held him
motionless.</p>

<p>"For Christ's sake, let us go!" he urged, in an
agonized whisper. "See what those demons are about
to do! I fear not battle, Wayland, as you know; but
the scene yonder unmans me."</p>

<p>It is hard for me to describe now what then I saw.
The entire centre of the great encampment was
brightly lit by a huge blazing fire, around which hundreds
of Indians were gathered, leaping and shouting
in their frenzy, while above the noise of their discordant
voices we could distinguish the flat notes of the
wooden drum, the dull pounding of which reminded
me of the solemn tolling of a funeral bell. What
atrocities had been going on, I know not; but as we
gazed across at them in shuddering horror, forth from
the entrance of a lodge a dozen painted warriors drove
a white man, stripped to the waist, his hands bound
behind him. As he stumbled forward, a bevy of
squaws lashed him with corded whips. I caught one
glimpse of his face in the light of the flames; it was
that of a young soldier I recalled having seen the evening
before within the Fort, playing a violin. He was
a brave lad, and although his face was pale and drawn
by suffering, he fronted the crazed mob that buffeted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"> 288 </a></span>
him with no sign of fear, his eyes roving about as if
still seeking some possible avenue of escape. Once he
sprang suddenly aside, tripping a giant brave who
grasped him, and disappeared amid the lodges, only
to be dragged forth a moment later and pushed forward,
horribly beaten with clubs at every step.</p>

<p>On a sudden, that shrieking, undulating crowd
fell away, and we could see the young man standing
alone, bound to a stake, his body leaning forward as
if held to its erect posture merely by the bonds. The
limp drooping of his head made me think him already
unconscious, possibly dead from some chance fatal
blow; but as the flames burst out in a roar at his feet,
and shot up, red and glaring, to his waist, he gave
utterance to one terrible cry of agony, and it seemed
to me I gazed fairly into his tortured eyes and could
read their pitiful appeal. Twice I raised my rifle, the
sight upon his heart,&mdash;but durst not fire. No consideration
of my own peril held back the pressure of
the trigger,&mdash;'twas the remembrance of Mademoiselle.
It was beyond my strength of will to withstand
such strain long.</p>

<p>"Come," I groaned to De Croix, my hands pressed
tightly over my eyes to shut out the sight, "it will
craze us both to stay here longer, nor dare we aid the
poor fellow even by a shot."</p>

<p>He lay face downward on the soft mud of the
bank, and I had to shake him before he so much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"> 289 </a></span>
moved. We crept on together, until we came out
through the thick bushes into the open prairie, and
faced each other, our lips white and our bodies shaking
with the horror of what we had just seen.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" he faltered, "'twill forever haunt
me."</p>

<p>"It has greatly undone me," I answered, striving
to control my voice, for I felt the necessity of coolness
if I hoped to command him; "but if we would save
her from meeting a like fate, we must remain men."</p>

<p>"Then, for God's sake, find some spot where I
may rest for an hour," he urged. "My brain seems
reeling, and I fear it will give way if I remain in sight
or sound of such horrors."</p>

<p>In spite of all I had seen, it was still my desire to
creep in among the deserted lodges while darkness
shrouded the outermost of them; but I felt that some
safe hiding-place must first be found for my companion.
To attempt to take him with me while in such
a nervous state would be only to invite disaster.</p>

<p>"De Croix," I asked, "know you if the Indians
have destroyed the house that stood by the fork of the
north river, where the settler Ouilmette lived?"</p>

<p>"I marked it through Lieutenant Helm's field-glass
yesterday. 'Tis partially burned, yet the walls
still stand."</p>

<p>"Then 't will serve us most excellently to hide in,
for there will be naught left within likely to attract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"> 290 </a></span>
marauders. Think you that you could find it through
the night?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, and it was easy to see his nerves
were on edge.</p>

<p>"Alone?" he gasped brokenly. "My God, no!"</p>

<p>There was seemingly no way out of it, for it would
have been little short of murder to leave him alone on
that black prairie, nor would harsh words have greatly
mended matters. We were fully an hour at it, creeping
cautiously along behind the scattered bushes until
we passed the forks and swam the river's northerly
branch. The action did him good, and greatly helped
to steady my own nerves, as the uproar of the savages
died steadily away behind us.</p>

<p>At last we came out upon a slight knoll, and found
ourselves close beside the low charred walls of what
remained of Ouilmette's log-cabin. 'Twas a most
gloomy and desolate spot, but quiet enough, with
never the rustle of a leaf to awake the night, or
startle us.</p>

<p>"Have you got back your nerve, Monsieur?" I
asked, as we paused before the dark outline, "or must
I also help you to explore within?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not shadows that terrify me," he answered,
no doubt thoroughly ashamed of his weakness, and
eager to make amends; "nor is it likely that anything
to affright me greatly is behind these walls."</p>

<p>I lay prone in the grass at the corner of the cabin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"> 291 </a></span>
my eyes fixed upon the distant Indian village, where
I could yet plainly distinguish numberless black figures
dodging about between me and the flames; while
further to the east, the greater blaze of the Fort buildings
lighted up, in a wide arc, the deserted prairie. I
gave little consideration to De Croix's exploit,&mdash;indeed,
I had almost forgotten it, when suddenly the
fellow sprang backward out of the open door, a cry of
wild terror upon his lips, and his hands outstretched
as if to ward off some unearthly vision.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" he sobbed hoarsely, falling upon
his knees. "'Twas the face of Marie!"</p>

</span><span class="hidden">H</span>E acted so like a crazed man,
grovelling face downward in
the grass, that I had to hold
him, fearful lest his noise
might attract attention from
our enemies.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, De Croix!" I
commanded sternly, my
hand hard upon him, my
eyes peering through the darkness to determine if
possible the cause for his mysterious fright. "What
is it that has so driven you out of your senses?"</p>

<p>He half rose, staring back at the black shadow of
the dim doorway, his face white as chalk in the star-light
and faint glare of the distant fires.</p>

<p>"'Twas the face of a dead woman," he gasped,
pointing forward, "there, just within the door! I saw
her buried three years ago, I swear; yet, God be merciful!
she awaited me yonder in the gloom."</p>

<p>"Pish!" I exclaimed, thoroughly disgusted at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"> 293 </a></span>
weakness, and rising to my feet. "Your nerves are
unstrung by what we have been through, and you
dream of the dead."</p>

<p>"It is not so!" he protested, his voice faltering
pitifully; "I saw her, Monsieur,&mdash;nor was she once
this day in my thought until that moment."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall soon know if there is a ghost
within," I answered shortly, determined to make quick
end of it. "Remain here, while I go into the house
and see what I can find."</p>

<p>For a moment he clung to me like a frightened
child; but I shook off his hands a bit roughly, and
stepped boldly across the threshold. That was an age
when faith in ghostly visitations yet lingered to
harass the souls of men. I confess my heart beat more
rapidly than usual, as I paused an instant to peer
through the shadowy gloom within. It was a small,
low room, with a litter of broken furniture strewing
the earthen floor; but the log-walls were quite bare.
The flicker of the still blazing Fort illuminated the
interior sufficiently to enable me to make out these
simple details, and to see that the place was without
living occupant.</p>

<p>There was only one other apartment in the building,
and I walked back until I came upon the door
which separated the two, and flung it open. As I did
so I thought I saw a shadow, the dim flitting of a
woman's form between me and the farther wall; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"> 294 </a></span>
as I sprang hastily forward, grasping after the spectral
vision, I touched nothing save the rough logs. Twice
I made the circuit of that restricted space, so confident
was I of my own eye-witness; but I found nothing,
and could only pause perplexed, staring about in
wonder.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that my own overtaxed nerves
were at fault, and that if I was to accomplish anything
before daylight I must say nothing likely to alarm De
Croix further.</p>

<p>"Come, Monsieur!" I said, as I came out and
shook him into attention, "there is naught within more
dangerous than shadows, or perchance a rat. Nor
have I any time longer to dally over such boyishness.
I had supposed you a soldier and a brave man, not a
nerveless girl to be frightened in the dark. Come,
there is ample hiding-space behind the walls, and I
purpose leaving you here to regain some measure of
your lost courage while I try a new venture of my
own."</p>

<p>"Where go you?"</p>

<p>"To learn if I may gain entrance to the Indian
camp unobserved. There can be no better time than
while they are occupied yonder."</p>

<p>He looked uneasily about him into the dark corners,
shuddering.</p>

<p>"I would rather go with you," he protested,
weakly. "I have not the heart to remain here alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"> 295 </a></span></p>

<p>"Nevertheless, here you stay," I retorted shortly,
thoroughly exasperated by his continued childishness;
"you are in no spirit to meet the perils yonder. Conquer
your foolishness, Monsieur, for I know well 'tis
not part of your nature so to exhibit fear."</p>

<p>"'Tis naught alive that I so shrink from; never
have I been affrighted of living man."</p>

<p>"True; nor have I ever found the dead able
greatly to harm. But now I go forth to a plain duty,
and you must wait me here."</p>

<p>I did not glance back at him, although I knew he
had sunk dejected on a bench beside the door; but
with careful look at the priming of my rifle, I stepped
forth into the open, and started down the slight slope
leading to the river. A fringe of low, straggling trees
hid my movements from observation by possible
watchers along the southern bank; nor could I perceive
with any definiteness what was going on there.
The fires had died down somewhat, and I thought the
savage yelling and clamor were considerably lessened.</p>

<p>I confess I went forward hesitatingly, and was
doubtful enough about the outcome; but I saw no
other means by which I might hope to locate Mademoiselle
definitely, and I valued my own life now only
as it concerned hers. The selfish cowardice of De
Croix if cowardice it truly was served merely to
stir me to greater recklessness and daring, and I felt
ready to venture all if I might thereby only pluck her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"> 296 </a></span>
from the grasp of those red fiends. As I crept through
the fringe of bushes which lined the bank, my eyes
were on the darkened upper extremity of the Indian
camp, and all my thoughts were concentrated upon a
plan of entrance to it. I may have been somewhat
careless, for I had no conception of any serious peril
until after I had crossed the stream, and it certainly
startled me to hear a voice at my very elbow,&mdash;a
strange voice, beautifully soft and low.</p>

<p>"You have the movement of an Indian; yet I
think you are white. What seek you here?"</p>

<p>I turned quickly and faced the speaker, my rifle
flung forward ready for action. The light was poor
enough there amid the shadows, yet the single glimpse
I had told me instantly I faced the mysterious woman
of the Indian camp. For a moment I made no response,
held speechless by surprise; and she questioned
again, almost imperatively.</p>

<p>"I asked, why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I am one, by the grace of God, spared from the
massacre," I answered blindly. "But you?&mdash;I saw
you within the Indian camp only last night. Surely
you are not a savage?"</p>

<p>"That I know not. I sometimes fear the savage
is part of all our natures, and that I am far removed
from the divine image of my Master. But I am not an
Indian, if that is what you mean. If to be white is
a grace in your sight, I am of that race, though there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"> 297 </a></span>
are times when I would have been prouder to wear the
darker skin. The red men kill, but they do not lie, nor
deceive women. I remember you now,&mdash;you were
with the White Chief from Dearborn, and tried to approach
me when Little Sauk interfered. Why did you
do that?"</p>

<p>Her manner and words were puzzling, but I knew
no better way than to answer frankly.</p>

<p>"I sought Elsa Matherson,&mdash;are you she?"</p>

<p>The girl&mdash;for she could certainly have been little
more&mdash;started perceptibly at the name, and bent
eagerly forward, peering with new interest into my
face.</p>

<p>"Elsa Matherson?" she questioned, dwelling
upon the words as though they awoke memories. "It
is indeed long since I have heard the name. Where
knew you her?"</p>

<p>"I have never known her; but her father was
my father's friend, and I sought her because of that
friendship."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"At Fort Dearborn, where she was left an
orphan."</p>

<p>"How strange! how very strange indeed! 'Tis a
small world. Elsa Matherson! and at Dearborn?"</p>

<p>Was it acting, for some purpose unknown to me,&mdash;or
what might be the secret of these strange
expressions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"> 298 </a></span></p>

<p>"Then you are not the one I seek?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, looking keenly toward me through
the dim light.</p>

<p>"I have not said who I may be," she answered
evasively. "Whatever name I may once have borne
was long ago forgotten, and to the simple children
about me I am only Sister Celeste. 'Tis enough to
live by in this wilderness, and the recording angel of
God knows whether even that is worthy. But I have
been waiting to learn why you are here, creeping
through the bushes like a savage! Nor do I believe
you to be altogether alone. Was there not one with
you yonder at the house? Why did he cry out so
loudly, and fall?"</p>

<p>"He imagined he saw a ghost within. He claimed
to have recognized the face of a dead woman he once
knew."</p>

<p>"A dead woman? What is the man's name?
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Captain de Croix, an officer of the French army."</p>

<p>She sighed quickly, as if relieved, one hand pressed
against her forehead, and sat thinking.</p>

<p>"I know not the name, but it seems strange that
the chance sight of my face should work such havoc
with his nerves. Spoke he not even the name of the
woman?"</p>

<p>"I think he cried some name as he fell, but I recall
it not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"> 299 </a></span></p>

<p>"And you? You are only seeking a way of escape
from the savages?"</p>

<p>For a moment I hesitated; but surely, I thought,
this strange young woman was of white blood, and
seemingly an enthusiast in the religion I also professed,
and I might safely trust her with my purpose.</p>

<p>"I am seeking entrance within the encampment,
hoping thus to rescue a maiden whom I believe to be
prisoner in the hands of the Indians."</p>

<p>"A maiden,&mdash;Elsa Matherson?"</p>

<p>"Nay, another; one I have learned to love so well
that I now willingly risk even torture for her sake.
You are a woman, and have a woman's heart; you
exercise some strange power among these savages.
I beg you to aid me."</p>

<p>She sat with clasped hands, her eyes lowered upon
the grass.</p>

<p>"Whatsoever power I have comes from God," she
said solemnly; "and there be times, such as now,
when it seems as if He held me unworthy of His
trust."</p>

<p>"But you will aid me in whatever way you can?"</p>

<p>"You are sure you love this maiden?"</p>

<p>"Would I be here, think you, otherwise?"</p>

<p>She did not answer immediately, but crept across
the little space separating us until she could look more
closely into my face, scanning it earnestly with her
dark eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"> 300 </a></span></p>

<p>"You have the appearance of a true man," she
said finally. "Does the maid love you?"</p>

<p>"I know not," I stammered honestly, confused by
so direct a question. "I fear not; yet I would save
her even then."</p>

<p>I felt her hand touch mine as if in sudden
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she spoke gravely, "love has never
been kind to me, and I have learned to put small trust
in the word as it finds easy utterance upon men's lips.
A man swore once, even at the altar, that he loved me;
and when he had won my heart he left me for another.
If I believed you were such a man I would rather
leave this girl to her fate among the savages yonder."</p>

<p>"I am not of that school," I protested earnestly.
"I am of a race that love once and forever. But you,
who are you? Why are you here in the midst of these
savages? You bear a strange likeness to her I would
save, but for the lighter shade of your hair."</p>

<p>She drew back slightly, removing her hand from
mine, but with gentleness.</p>

<p>"It would do you little good to know my story,"
she said firmly. "I am no longer of the world, and my
life is dedicated to a service you might deem sacrifice.
Moreover, we waste time in such idle converse; and
if it be my privilege to aid you at all, I must learn
more, so as to plan safely."</p>

<p>"You have the freedom of the camp yonder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"> 301 </a></span></p>

<p>"I hardly know," she responded sadly. "God
has placed in my poor hands, Monsieur, a portion of
His work amid those benighted, sin-stained creatures
there. Times come, as now, when the wild wolf breaks
loose, and my life hardly is safe among them. I fled
the camp to-night,&mdash;not from fear, Christ knows, but
because I am a woman, and too weak physically to
bear the sight of suffering that I am helpless to
relieve. It is indeed Christ's mercy that so few of
your company were spared to be thus tortured; but
there was naught left for me but prayer."</p>

<p>She stooped forward, her hands pressed over her
eyes as though she would shut out the horror.</p>

<p>"Yet know you who among the whites have thus
far preserved their lives?" I urged, in an agony of suspense.
"Were any of the women brought alive to
the camp?"</p>

<p>"It was my fortune to see but one; nor was I
permitted to approach her,&mdash;a sweet-faced girl, yet
she could not be the one you seek, for she wore a
wedding-ring. She was saved through the friendship
of Black Partridge, and I heard that she is a daughter
of the Silver-man."</p>

<p>"Ay! Mrs. Helm! Thank God! But was she
the only one?"</p>

<p>"Truly, I know not; for I was forced away from
sight of much that went on. Little Sauk has a white
maiden hidden in his lodge, who was brought from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"> 302 </a></span>
battle. I have not seen the girl, but know this through
others who were angry at his good-fortune."</p>

<p>"Could we reach there, think you, unobserved?"</p>

<p>She rose, and gazed anxiously across the stream,
her face showing clear and fair in the faint light of
those distant fires, while I caught the glimmer of a
pearl rosary about her white throat and marked a
silver crucifix resting against her breast.</p>

<p>"It will be life itself you venture in such an attempt,"
she said softly, "even its loss through torture;
yet 'tis a deed that might be done, for the Indians are
fairly crazed with blood and liquor, and will pay small
heed to aught save their heathen orgies."</p>

<p>"Then let us venture it."</p>

<p>She turned slightly and looked at me intently, her
dark eyes filled with serious thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will go," she responded at last, slowly.
"If through God's grace we may thus preserve a life,
it will be well worthy the sacrifice, and must be His
desire."</p>

<p>For another moment we waited there silently,
standing side by side, gazing anxiously across the dark
water, and listening intently to the varied discordant
sounds borne to us on the night air. I know not what
may have been in her thought; but upon my lips there
was a silent prayer that we might be safely guided in
our desperate mission. I wondered still who this
strange young woman could be, so surrounded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"> 303 </a></span>
mystery, a companion of savages, and still gentle and
refined in word and manner. I dare not ask again, nor
urge her confidence; for there was that of reserve about
her which held me speechless. I glanced aside, marking
again the clear pure contour of her face, and my look
seemed instantly to arouse her from her reverie.</p>

<p>"I expect little trouble until we near the centre
of the camp," she said, thoughtfully. "'Tis dark amid
the northern lodges, and we shall meet with no warriors
there unless they be so far gone in intoxication
as to be no longer a source of danger. But come,
friend, the longer we tarry the less bright grows the
hope of success."</p>

<p>A slender bark canoe rested close beneath the
bank, and she motioned me into it, grasping the paddle
without a word, and sending the narrow craft with
swift, silent strokes across the stream. The other shore
was unprotected; so, hesitating only long enough to
listen for a moment, much as some wild animal might,
she crept forward cautiously into the black lodge-shadows,
while I instantly followed, imitating as best
I could her slightest movement. We met no obstacle
to our advance,&mdash;not even the snarls and barkings of
the innumerable curs, usually the sleepless guardians
of such encampments of savages. I soon saw that as
we crept around lodge after lodge in our progress, the
light of the blazing fires in our front grew constantly
brighter and the savage turbulence more pronounced.</p>

<p>At last the girl came to a sudden pause, peering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"> 304 </a></span>
cautiously forward from beneath the shadow of the
lodge that hid us; and as I glanced over her shoulder,
the wild scene was revealed in each detail of savagery.</p>

<p>"'Tis as far as you will dare venture," she whispered,
her lips at my ear. "I know not the exact limit
of our progress, but the lodge of Little Sauk lies beyond
the fire, and I must make the rest of the distance
alone."</p>

<p>"But dare you?" I questioned uneasily. "Will
they permit even you to pass unharmed?"</p>

<p>She smiled almost sadly.</p>

<p>"I have many friends among them, blood-stained
as they are, and little as I have accomplished for the
salvation of their souls. I have been with them much,
and my father long held their confidence ere he died.
I have even been adopted into the tribe of the Pottawattomies.
None are my enemies among that nation
save the medicine-men, and they will scarce venture to
molest me even in this hour of their power and crime.
Too well they know me to be under protection of their
chiefs; nor are they insensible to the sanctity of my
faith. Ay, and even their superstition has proved my
safeguard."</p>

<p>The expression of curiosity in my eyes appealed
to her, and as if in answer she rested one hand upon
her uncovered head, the hair of which shone like dull
red gold in the firelight.</p>

<p>"You mean that?" I asked, dimly recalling something
I had once heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"> 305 </a></span></p>

<p>She shook the heavy coiled mass loose from its
bondage, until it rippled in gleaming waves of color
over her shoulders, and smiled back at me, yet not
without traces of deep sadness in her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tis an Indian thought," she explained softly,
"that such hair as mine is a special gift of the Great
Spirit, and renders its wearer sacred. What was often
spoken most lightly about in other days has in this
dread wilderness proved my strongest defence. God
uses strange means, Monsieur, to accomplish His purpose
with the heathen."</p>

<p>She paused, listening intently to a sudden noise
behind us.</p>

<p>"Creep in here, Monsieur," she whispered, quickly
lifting an edge of the skin-covering of the lodge. "A
party is returning from the Fort, perchance with more
prisoners. Lie quiet there until I return; it will not
be long."</p>

<p>I crawled through the slight opening into that
black interior, turning to hold open the flap sufficiently
to peer forth once more. I knew not where she vanished,
as she faded away like a shadow; but I had
hardly secured refuge, when a dozen painted warriors
trooped by, shouting their fierce greeting. In the
midst of them, half-stripped, and bleeding as if from
freshly inflicted wounds, staggered a white man; and
as the firelight fell full upon his haggard face, I recognized
De Croix.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">W</span>HAT followed was so extraordinary and incredible
that I hesitate to record it,
lest there be those who,
judging in their own conceit,
and knowing little of savage
Indian nature, may question
the truth of my narration.
Yet I am now too old a
man to permit unjust criticism to swerve me from
the task I have assumed.</p>

<p>The extreme of misery that overwhelmed me at
the moment when I beheld my comrade driven forward
like a trapped beast to a death by torture, found expression
in a sudden moan, which, fortunately for me,
was unnoted amid the shouts of greeting that arose
around the fire when those gathered there caught sight
of the new-comers. Instantly all was confusion and
uproar; a scene of savage debauchery, unrelieved by a
redeeming feature or a sign of mercy. It was as if poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"> 307 </a></span>
De Croix had been hurled, bound and gagged, into a
den of infuriated wolves, whose jaws already dripped
with the blood of slaughter. Gleaming weapons, glaring
and lustful eyes, writhing naked bodies, pressed
upon him on every side, hurling him back and forth
in brute play, every tongue mocking him, in every uplifted
hand a weapon for a blow.</p>

<p>The fierce animal nature within these red fiends
was now uppermost, fanned into hot flame by hours
of diabolical torture of previous victims, in which they
had exhausted every expedient of cruelty to add to the
dying agony of their prey. To this, fiery liquor had
yielded its portion; while the weird incantations of
their priests had transformed the most sober among
them into demons of malignity. If ever, earlier in the
night, their chiefs had exercised any control over them,
that time was long since past; and now the inflamed
warriors, bursting all restraint, answered only to the
war-drum or made murderous response to the superstition
of their medicine-men.</p>

<p>The entire centre of the encampment was a scene
of drunken orgy, a phantasmagoria of savage figures,
satanic in their relentless cruelty and black barbarity.
Painted hundreds, bedecked with tinkling beads and
waving feathers, howled and leaped in paroxysms of
fury about the central fire, hacking at the helpless
bodies of the dead victims of earlier atrocities, tearing
their own flesh, beating each other with whips like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"> 308 </a></span>
wire, their madly brandished weapons flashing angrily
in the flame-lit air.</p>

<p>Squaws, dirty of person and foul of mouth, often
more ferocious in appearance and cruel in action than
their masters, were everywhere, dodging amid the
writhing bodies, screaming shrilly from excitement,
their long coarse hair whipping in the wind. Nor were
they all Pottawattomies: others had flocked into this
carnival of blood,&mdash;Wyandots and Sacs, even Miamis,
until now it had become a contest for supremacy in
savagery. 'Twas as if hell itself had opened, to vomit
forth upon the prairie that blood-stained crew of dancing
demons and shock the night with crime.</p>

<p>A dead white man,&mdash;the poor lad whose early
torture we had witnessed,&mdash;his half-burnt body still
hanging suspended at the stake, was in the midst of
them, a red glare of embers beneath him, the curling
smoke creeping upward into the black sky from about
his head like devil's incense. In front of this hideous
spectacle, regardless of the mutilated body, sat the
ferocious old demon I had seen the evening previous,
his head crowned with a bison's horns, his naked
breast daubed with red and yellow figures to resemble
crawling snakes, his face the hideous representation
of a grinning skull. Above all other sounds rang out
his yells, inciting his fellows to further atrocities, and
accompanied by the dull booming of his wooden drum.</p>

<p>It was into this pack of ravening beasts that poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"> 309 </a></span>
De Croix staggered from the surrounding shadows;
and they surged about him, clamoring for place, greeting
their new-found victim with jeers and blows and
hoots of bitter hatred, viciously slashing at him with
their knives, so that the very sight of it turned me
sick, and made me sink my head upon my arms in helplessness
and horror. A sudden cessation in the infernal
uproar led me to peer forth once more. They had
dragged the charred and blackened trunk of the dead
soldier down from the post where it had hung suspended,
and were fastening De Croix in its place,
binding his hands behind the support, and kicking
aside the still glowing embers of the former fire to
give him space to stand. It was brutally, fiendishly
done, with thongs wound about his body so tightly as
to lift the flesh in great welts, and those who labored
at it striking cruel blows at his naked, quivering form,
spitting viciously into his face, with taunting words,
seeking through every form of ferocious ingenuity to
wring from their helpless victim some sign of suffering,
some shrieking plea for mercy. Once I marked
a red devil stick a sharpened sliver of wood into the
Frenchman's bare shoulder, touched it with fire, and
then stand back laughing as the bound victim sought
vainly to dislodge the torturing brand.</p>

<p>Whatever of shrinking fear De Croix may have
exhibited an hour before, however he may have trembled
from ghostly haunting and been made coward by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"> 310 </a></span>
contact with the dead, he was a man now, a soldier
worthy of his uniform and of his manhood. Merciful
God! but it made my heart swell to see the lad, as he
faced those dancing devils and looked coolly into the
eyes of death. His face was indeed ghastly white in
the fire-glow, save where the red stains of blood disfigured
it; but there was no wavering in the bold
black eyes, no cowardly shrinking from his fate, no
moan of weakness from between his tightly pressed
lips. Scarce could I think of him then as being the
same gentle exquisite that rode on the westward trail
in powdered hair and gaudy waistcoat, worrying lest
a pinch of dust might soil his faultless linen,&mdash;this
begrimed, blood-stained, torn figure, naked to the
waist, his small-clothes clinging in rags from his
thighs, his head bare and with long black locks streaming
to his shoulders. Yet it was now, not then, he won
my respect and honor.</p>

<p>Once I saw him strain desperately at the cords in
a mad endeavor to break free, his flashing eyes on the
demons who were torturing him beyond endurance.
Well I knew how he longed to lay hand on any weapon,
and thus die, battling to the end; had he succeeded,
I doubt not I should have been at his side, forgetful
of all else in the struggle. The deer-skin thongs, as
unyielding as iron, held him fast. I ground my teeth
and dug my nails into the earth to hold me from leaping
forward in hopeless attempt at rescue, as a huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"> 311 </a></span>
brute struck him savagely with clinched hand across
the lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if in response to some low spoken
order, the jostling horde fell aside from before him,
leaving a narrow space unoccupied. I had no time to
wonder at this movement before a tomahawk, whirling
rapidly and flashing like a ruby in the red glare, went
hurling forward, and buried its shining blade deep in
the post an inch from the prisoner's head, the handle
quivering with the force of impact. Again and again,
amid yells of derision and encouragement, they threw,
twice bringing token of blood from the grazed cheek
and once cleaving the ear nearest me as if by a knife-blow.
In spite of all, De Croix sneered at them,
mocked their efforts, taunted them with their lack of
skill, no doubt seeking to infuriate them and cause the
striking of a merciful death-blow.</p>

<p>I trembled as I gazed, held there by a fascination
I could not overcome, shading my eyes when I saw
an arm uplifted to make a cast, and opening them in
dread unspeakable as I heard the dull impact of the
blow. Never in my life have I seen such marvellous
nerve as this French gallant displayed in those awful
moments; standing there motionless, with never a
tremor, no twitching of a muscle, his scornful eyes
following the deadly steel, his lips jeering at the
throwers, as he coolly played the game whose stake
was death. At last some savage cast from farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"> 312 </a></span>
back amid the mass of howling contestants; I failed
to see the upraised hand that grasped the weapon, but
caught its sudden gleam as it sped onward, and De
Croix was pinned helpless, the steel blade wedging his
long hair deep into the wood.</p>

<p>A dozen screaming squaws now hustled forward
the materials for a fire; I saw branches, roots, and
leaves, piled high about his knees, and marked with a
shudder the film of blue smoke as it soared upward
ere the flame caught the green wood. Then suddenly
some one kicked the pile over, hurling it into the faces
of those who stooped beside it; and the fierce clamor
ceased as if by magic.</p>

<p>I staggered to my knees, wondering what it could
mean,&mdash;this strange silence after all the uproar.
Then I saw. Out from the shadows, as if she herself
were one, the strange girl who had been my companion
glided forward into the red radius of the flame, and
faced them, her back to De Croix.</p>

<p>Never shall I fail to recall her as she then appeared,&mdash;a
veritable goddess of light fronting the
fiends of darkness. With cheeks so white as to seem
touched with death, her dark eyes glowed in consciousness
of power, while her long, sweeping tresses rippled
below her waist, gleaming in a wild red beauty almost
supernatural. How womanly she was, how fair to
look upon, and how unconscious of aught save her
mission! One hand she held before her in imperious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"> 313 </a></span>
gesture of command; with the other she uplifted the
crucifix, until the silver Christ sparkled in the light.</p>

<p>"Back!" she said clearly. "Back! You shall
not torture this man! I know him. He is a soldier
of France!"</p>

</span><span class="hidden">T</span>HE word uttered by the
strange woman was one to
conjure with even then in
the Illinois country. Many
a year had passed since the
French flag ruled those
prairies, yet not a warrior
there but knew how the men
of that race avenged an
injury,&mdash;how swift their stroke, how keen their
steel.</p>

<p>I watched the startled throng press closely backward,
as if awed by her mysterious presence, influenced
insensibly by her terse sentence of command, each
dusky face a reflex of its owner's perplexity. Drunken
as most of them were, crazed with savage blood-lust
and hours of remorseless torture of their victims, for
the moment that sweet vision of womanly purity held
them motionless, as if indeed the figure of the Christ
she uplifted before their faces had taught them abhorrence
of their crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"> 315 </a></span></p>

<p>But it was not for long. To hundreds of those
present she was merely an unknown white woman;
while even to those who knew her best, the Pottawattomies,
she appeared only as one who came to
balk them of their revenge. They may have held her
person inviolate amid their lodges, and even have
countenanced her strange teaching; but now she had
ventured too far in attempting thus to stand between
them and their victim. They held back a single moment,
halted by her fearlessness, rendered cowardly
by vague superstitions regarding her religious power;
but after the first breathless pause of dumb astonishment
and irresolution, voice after voice arose in hoarse
cries of rage and shouts of disapproval. There was
a surging forward of the straining red line, while in
their front howled and gesticulated the hideous old
medicine-man, his painted face distorted by passion,
eager to grasp this auspicious moment to cast down
forever one who had sought to end his superstitious
rule among the tribe. I marked how she drew back
as they advanced, retreating step by step,&mdash;not, in
deed, as if she feared them, but rather as if some definite
purpose led her movement. Her eyes never
wavered, her hand still uplifted the gleaming cross,
as she retreated slowly, until she stood directly before
De Croix, where he hung helplessly staring at her with
an expression of fear in his face strangely at variance
with his late show of desperate courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"> 316 </a></span></p>

<p>"Back!" she cried again, but now in a deeper
and fuller voice that sounded like a clear-toned bell
above the uproar. "I tell you I will kill this man
with my own hand before I permit you to put further
torture upon him!"</p>

<p>An instant only did this threat halt the gathering
rush. Some one voiced an Indian insult, and there
came a fierce surging forward, although no warrior
among them seemed eager to lead in the attack. I
saw the woman lift her hand, and caught the glimmer
of a steel blade; and even as I sprang erect, partially
flinging aside the obstructing flap of the lodge, an
Indian, stalking silently forth from the shadows, faced
the mob, standing motionless within a foot of the desperate
girl, and with his back toward her. One glance
at that tall thin figure, the stern face, the long white
hair, told me it was the great war-chief of the Pottawattomies,
Gomo; and I sank back trembling from the
reaction of that moment's strain.</p>

<p>His words were calm, deliberate, commanding;
but the angry roar with which they were greeted made
me fear the horde he faced so resolutely was now beyond
control. He smiled, his thin lips curling in
derision as he gazed with contempt into the threatening
faces pressing closer upon every side.</p>

<p>"Fear not," he murmured aside to the watchful
woman, and resting one hand upon her arm. "Cut
loose the prisoner!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"> 317 </a></span></p>

<p>She turned instantly to her task, while he spoke
briefly the names of his chiefs; and as each was called
in turn, a warrior came from among the mass and
silently stood beside him. A dozen came forth thus,
stalwart, grim-faced braves, many with fresh scalps
dangling at their belts.</p>

<p>Gomo now spoke again, using the French tongue,
that all present might better grasp his meaning.</p>

<p>"Brothers," he said gravely, "this squaw is Pottawattomie.
She was adopted by our people and lives
in our lodges. Pottawattomies are friends to Frenchmen;
there is no war between us. Why should
Wyandots and Sacs wish to burn a Frenchman?"</p>

<p>For a moment no one ventured to reply; the mob
stood halted now, robbed of its leaders and its courage,
even the noisy medicine-man silenced before this stern
array of protecting chiefs. Loose as was Indian discipline
and tribal authority, even in drunkenness those
desperate warriors dared not openly disregard such
a display of power.</p>

<p>"Have the Pottawattomies spoken well?" questioned
the old chief, sternly, "or have our words
wronged our brothers?"</p>

<p>A giant of a fellow, whose broad face and huge
head seemed disproportionate even to his big body,
his long coarse hair profusely ornamented with shells
and beads flashing gaudily in the firelight, pushed his
way out from among the silent mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"> 318 </a></span></p>

<p>"Gomo, the great war-chief of the Pottawattomies,
has spoken well," he said in a deep voice that
rolled like distant thunder. "The Wyandots did not
know; they war not with Frenchmen, nor harm the
women of the Pottawattomies. The Great Spirit hath
made us brothers, and we have smoked together the
pipe of peace."</p>

<p>Gomo moved forward with Indian dignity, and
exchanged solemn greeting with the new-comer.</p>

<p>"It makes the hearts of the Pottawattomies light
to hear the words of Sau-ga-nash," he said gravely.
Then he turned and waved his hand to his clustered
warriors. "Release the Frenchman, and place him
for safety in the council lodge. Pass the woman free.
It is the will of our chiefs."</p>

<p>The council lodge! I glanced about me apprehensively;
surely this must be the same tepee in which
Captain Heald and I had met the chiefs! There were
no signs of ordinary Indian occupancy, and now as
I looked about me the firelight from without revealed
clearly the shading of those grotesque figures I recalled
as having been sketched upon the outer covering.
So it was here that De Croix was to be confined!
I crept back hastily, dropping into place the loosened
flap through which I had been peering. A skin or
two were lying on the grassy floor; and I grasped the
larger of these, drawing it over me while I rolled
as closely as possible against the farther wall, hoping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"> 319 </a></span>
desperately that no Indian guards would be posted
within.</p>

<p>The uproar outside continued, as if there were
still opposition to the commands of the chiefs; but
presently, as I peeped through a hole in the skin held
over me, I perceived a sudden flash of light as the flap
covering the entrance was drawn aside. I saw a number
of dark hands thrust within, a savage face or two
peering for a moment about the darkened interior;
but to my inexpressible relief only one body was thrust
inside, with such violence, however, as to cause the
man to fall face downward at full length. The next
instant the lodge was again wrapped in utter darkness.
By God's mercy I remained undiscovered, and was
alone with De Croix.</p>

<p>For a short time, assured as I was of this fact,
I did not venture to creep from my place of concealment,
or make my presence known to my companion.
What ears might be listening, I knew not; nor dared
I trust too much to the Frenchman's already overtaxed
nerves. He did not move from the position
where he fell; but I could hear him groan and sob,
with now and then a broken ejaculation. Without,
the yelling and uproar grew perceptibly less, although
an occasional outburst gave evidence that the carousal
was not wholly ended. Finally I pushed back the robe
that covered me, now grown uncomfortably warm,
and crept cautiously toward the place where I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"> 320 </a></span>
him to be lying. It was intensely dark, and I was still
fearful lest he might cry out if I startled him.</p>

<p>"De Croix," I whispered, "make no alarm; I
am Wayland."</p>

<p>"Wayland!" I could mark the amazement in his
tone, as he instantly sat upright, peering through the
gloom in the direction whence my voice came. <i>"Mon
Dieu!</i> You are here? You saw all of it?"</p>

<p>"Ay," I answered, reaching out and groping in
the darkness until I grasped his hand. "You have had
a hard time, my lad; but the worst is over, and hope
remains for us both."</p>

<p>He shuddered so violently I could feel the spasm
shake his body.</p>

<p>"'Twas not the dying," he protested; "but did
you see her, Wayland? Merciful God! was it really
a living woman who stood there, or a ghost returned
from the other world to haunt me and make living
worse than death?"</p>

<p>"You mean the sister who interposed to save
you?" I asked. "' She was as truly alive as either of
us. Think you she is not a stranger?"</p>

<p>He groaned, as if the confession was wrung from
him by the terror of eternal torment.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!</i> She is my wife!"</p>

<p>"Your wife?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my wife,&mdash;Marie Faneuf, of Montreal."</p>

<p>"But how comes she here, Monsieur, living in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"> 321 </a></span>
the Pottawattomie camp? And how comes it that you
sought another in this wilderness, if you were already
long wedded?"</p>

<p>"Saint Guise! but I cannot tell you," and his voice
shook with the emotion that swept him. "'Tis like
a black dream, from which I must yet awaken. She
died, I swear she died; the sisters told me so at the
convent of the Ursulines, whither she fled to escape
my unkindness,&mdash;for I did her wrong; and I stood by
the grave as the body they called hers was lowered
into the ground. For all these years have I thought
it true; yet the girl yonder was Marie. But you, Wayland,&mdash;know
you aught of her?"</p>

<p>"Only that she guided me hither in search
of Mademoiselle. On the way we conversed, and
she let me know that she had dedicated her life to
the service of these Indians, seeking to save their
souls."</p>

<p>"'Tis like enough; she was ever half a nun, and
most religious. Yet made she no mention of me, and
of my crying out at the house?&mdash;for I must indeed
have seen her there!"</p>

<p>"She asked me your name, Monsieur, and when
I told her she said she recalled it not. Knew she you
by some other?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, though I could mark his heavy
breathing, as if he strove with himself for mastery.
Nor did I speak again, eager as I now was to arrange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"> 322 </a></span>
some plan for the future; for this man was certainly
in no condition to counsel with.</p>

<p>I know not how long I may have rested there in
silence, seeking vainly in my own mind for some opening
of escape, or means whereby I might communicate
with Mademoiselle. Would the strange woman forget
me now, or would she venture upon a return with her
message? If not, I must grope forward without her,
hampered as I should be by this unnerved and helpless
Frenchman. Outside, the noise had almost wholly
ceased,&mdash;at least, close to where we were,&mdash;and I
could perceive that a slight tinge of returning day was
already in the air, faintly revealing the interior of the
lodge.</p>

<p>As I sat thus, drifting through inaction into a
more despairing mood, the rear covering of the tepee
moved almost imperceptibly, and I turned hastily to
seek the cause, my heart in my throat lest it prove an
enemy, perhaps some stealthy savage still seeking the
life of De Croix. It was far from being light as yet,
but there was sufficient to show me the faint outline
of a woman's figure. The Frenchman had seemingly
heard nothing; and I rose quickly and faced her
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You have found her?" I questioned anxiously.
"I beg you tell me that she yet lives!"</p>

<p>"Hush! you speak too loud," was the low reply.
"The one you seek is, I think, confined within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"> 323 </a></span>
lodge of Little Sauk, and thus far remains unharmed.
I have not been able to reach her, but she has been
described to me as young, with dark hair and eyes,
and as having been dragged from a horse near the
rear of the column. Think you she is the one you
seek?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed!" I cried, in a rapture of relief.
"Where is this lodge in which they hold her?"</p>

<p>She hesitated to answer, as if she somewhat
doubted my discretion.</p>

<p>"It is the third from the fire, in the row west
of this," she said at last. "But it is already daylight,
and you must lie hidden amid these skins until another
night, when I will strive to aid you. You will be safe
here, if you only keep hidden; and I have brought
with me food for you both."</p>

<p>I had quite forgotten De Croix, in my eagerness to
learn news of Mademoiselle; but now I realized he
had risen to his knees, and was gazing at our visitor
through the dim shadows as if half fearful even yet
that she was but a spectre. In that gray dawn his face
was ghastly in its whiteness,&mdash;the dark lines under
his eyes, his matted hair, and the traces of blood upon
his cheek, yielding a haggardness almost appalling.</p>

<p>"Marie!" he sobbed, catching his breath between
the words as if they choked him, "Marie, in God's
name, speak one word to me!"</p>

<p>I saw the girl start, looking around at him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"> 324 </a></span>
eyes widely opened, yet with an expression in them
I could not fathom; it was neither hatred nor love,
though it might easily have been sorrow.</p>

<p>"Marie," he urged, rendered despairing by her
silence, "I have done you wrong, great wrong; but
I thought you dead. They told me so,&mdash;they told me
it was your body they buried. Will you not speak a
word of mercy now?"</p>

<p>Dim as the light was, I saw her eyes were moist
as she gazed down upon him; but there was no faltering
in her voice.</p>

<p>"You were right, Monsieur le Marquis," she said
slowly, "Marie Faneuf is dead. It is only Sister
Celeste who has aided in the preservation of your life
in the name of the Master. Make your acknowledgment
to the Mother of Christ, not to me, for such
mercy."</p>

<p>I knew not when she passed out, or how; but we
were alone once more, and De Croix was lying with
his face buried in the short grass.</p>

</span>&nbsp;SLEPT at last, soundly, for
several hours, lying well
hidden behind the skins at
the back of the lodge. There
seemed nothing else to do;
for poor De Croix had no
thought other than that of
the woman who had just left
us, and I was exhausted by
hours of excitement and toil. He was asleep when
I awoke, lying just as I had left him, his face still
buried in the short trodden grass that carpeted the
floor.</p>

<p>It was so quiet without that I listened in vain for
a sound to indicate the presence of Indians. Silence
so profound was in strange contrast with the hideous
uproar of the preceding night, and curiosity led me
finally to project my head from beneath the lodge
covering and gain a cautious glimpse of the camp with
out. The yellow sunshine of the calm summer afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"> 326 </a></span>
rested hot and glaring on the draped skins of the
tepees, and on the brown prairie-grass, trampled by
hundreds of passing feet. I could perceive a few
squaws working lazily in the shade of the trees near
the bank of the river; but no other moving figures
were visible. Several recumbent forms were within
my sight, their faces toward the sun, evidently sleeping
off the heavy potations of the night. Otherwise the
great encampment appeared completely deserted;
there were no spirals of smoke rising above the lodge-poles,
no gossiping groups anywhere about.</p>

<p>It was plain enough to me. Those of the warriors
capable of further action were elsewhere engaged upon
some fresh foray, while the majority, overcome by
drinking, were asleep within their darkened lodges.
Surely, daylight though it was, no safer moment could
be expected in which to establish communication with
Toinette. With night the camp would be again astir;
and even if I succeeded in reaching her at some later
hour it would leave small margin of darkness for our
escape. Every moment of delay now added to our
grave peril, and there was much planning to be done
after we met. Possibly I should have waited, as I had
been told to do; but it was ever in my blood to act
rather than reason, and I am sure that in this case no
cause remains for regret.</p>

<p>I must confess that my heart beat somewhat
faster, as I crept slowly forth and peered cautiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"> 327 </a></span>
around the bulging side of the big lodge I had just
left, to assure myself no savages were stirring. It was
not that I greatly feared the venture, nor that a sense
of danger excited my nerves; but rather the one
thought in my mind was that now my way lay toward
Mademoiselle. How would she greet me? Should I
learn my fate from her tell-tale eyes, or by a sudden
gleam of surprise in her lovely face? These were the
reflections that inspired me, for a new hope had been
born within me through the forced confession of De
Croix.</p>

<p>There was little danger of exposure while I advanced
through the shelter of the lodges, for I was
always under partial cover. But I waited and watched
long before daring to pass across the wide open space
in the centre of which the fire had been kindled. The
torture-post yet stood there, black and charred, while
the ground beneath was littered with dead ashes. The
bodies of three white men, two of them naked and
marked by fire, lay close at hand, just as they had been
carelessly flung aside to make room for new victims;
yet I dared not stop to learn who they might have been
in life. The sight of their foul disfigurement only rendered
me the more eager to reach the living with a
message of hope.</p>

<p>I moved like a snake, dragging my body an inch
at a time by firmly grasping with extended hands the
tough grass-roots, and writhing forward as noiselessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"> 328 </a></span>
as if I were stalking some prey. There were times
when I advanced so slowly it would have puzzled a
watcher to determine whether mine was not also the
body of the dead. At length, even at that snail's rate
of progress, I gained the protection of the tepees upon
the other side of the camp, and skulked in among them.
The lodge just before me, blackened by paint and
weather, must be the one I sought. I rested close
within its shadow, striving to assure myself there was
no possibility of mistake. As my eyes lifted, I could
trace in dim outline the totem of the chief faintly
sketched on the taut skin: it was the same I had noted
on the brawny breast of Little Sauk.</p>

<p>Never did I move with greater woodland skill, for
I felt that all depended upon my remaining undiscovered;
a single false move now would defeat all hope.
Who might be within, concealed by that black covering,
was a mystery to be solved only by extremest
caution.</p>

<p>Inch by inch I worked the skin-covering of the
tepee entrance up from the ground, screwing my eye
to the aperture in an effort to penetrate the shrouded
interior. But the glare of the sun was so reflected into
my eyeballs, that it left me almost blind in the semi-gloom
beneath that dark roof, and I could distinguish
no object with certainty. Surely, nothing moved
within; and I drew myself slowly forward, until half my
body lay extended upon the beaten dirt-floor. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"> 329 </a></span>
then that I caught a glimpse of a face peering at me
from out the shadows,&mdash;the face of Toinette; and, alas
for my eager hopes of surprising her heart and solving
its secrets! the witch was actually laughing in silence
at my predicament. The sight made my face flush in
sudden indignation; but before I could find speech,
she had hastily accosted me.</p>

<p>"Good faith, Master Wayland! but I greet you
gladly!" she said, and her soft hand was warm upon
mine; "yet it truly caused me to smile to observe the
marvellous caution with which you came hither."</p>

<p>"It must have been indeed amusing," I answered,
losing all my vain aspirations in a moment under her
raillery; "though it is not every prisoner in an Indian
camp who could find like cause for merriment."</p>

<p>Her eyes grew sober enough as they rested inquiringly
on my face, for all that they still held an irritatingly
roguish twinkle in their depths.</p>

<p>"It was the expression upon your face which so
amused me," she explained. "I am not indifferent to
all that your coming means, nor to the horrors this
camp has witnessed. More than that, you appear to
me like one risen from the dead. I have truly mourned
for you, John Wayland. I lost all power, all desire for
resistance, when I saw you stricken from your horse,
and often since my eyes have been moist in thoughts
of you. No doubt 'twas but the sudden reaction from
seeing you again alive that made me so forgetful of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"> 330 </a></span>
these dread surroundings as to smile. I beg you to
forgive me; it was not heartlessness, but merely the
way of a thoughtless girl, Monsieur."</p>

<p>It had been impossible for me to resist her cajolery
from the beginning; and now I read in her eyes
the truth of all she spoke.</p>

<p>"There is naught for you to forgive, Mademoiselle,"
I answered, drawing myself wholly within the
tepee and resting on my knees. "But are you quite
alone here, and without guards?"</p>

<p>"For the present, yes. Little Sauk has been gone
from the camp for some hours. They watch me with
some care at night, yet of what use can their guarding
be? If I should get without the lodge, escape
would be hopeless for a girl like me. But now tell
me about yourself. Are you also prisoner to the Indians?
Surely I saw you struck down in that mad
<i>mle</i>. 'Twas then I lost heart, and gave up every
hope of rescue."</p>

<p>"No, I am not a prisoner, Mademoiselle. I fell,
stunned by a blow dealt me from behind, but was saved
from capture by the falling of my horse across my
body. I am here now of my own will, and for no other
purpose than to save you."</p>

<p>"To save me! Oh, Monsieur! it would make me
blush really to think I ranked so high in your esteem.
Was it not rather that other girl you came to seek,&mdash;the
one you sought so far through the wilderness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"> 331 </a></span>
only to find hidden in this encampment of savages?
Tell me, Monsieur, was she by any chance of fate the
heroine who last night plucked Captain de Croix from
the flames of torture?"</p>

<p>"You know, then, of his danger and deliverance?"
I said, not feeling eager to answer her query. "'Twas
a most brave and womanly act."</p>

<p>"A strange exercise of power, indeed, Monsieur,"
and she looked directly into my eyes; "and the savages
tell me she claimed to have knowledge of him."</p>

<p>Surely I had a right to relate the whole story of
De Croix's confession; yet somehow I did not deem
it the manly thing to do. Rather, I would let her learn
the truth in God's own time, and from other lips than
mine. Perchance she would respect me more in the
end for keeping silence now. But in this decision I
failed to consider that hasty words of explanation
might naturally lead her to believe the existing friendship
mine instead of his.</p>

<p>"We met her across the river in the darkness last
night," I answered. "At my request, she acted as my
guide into the Indian camp."</p>

<p>The expression in her eyes puzzled me; nor could
I interpret the sudden flush that lent color to her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are frank, Monsieur," she said quietly, "and
doubtless 'tis better so. But the strange situation of
this young woman has much of romance about it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"> 332 </a></span>
interests me greatly. How chances she to be here?
Surely she cannot be of Indian blood?"</p>

<p>"She holds connection with some sisterhood of
the Church, as I understand, and has lived for some
time amid the Pottawattomies, seeking to win the
heathen to Christ."</p>

<p>"A Catholic?" she asked, her eyes brightening
with deeper interest.</p>

<p>"Such is my understanding, though in truth she
never said as much to me. Indeed, we spoke little,
Mademoiselle, for our path was in the midst of peril,
even before the capture of poor De Croix upset all our
plans."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," she answered with a slight trace of
sarcasm in the soft voice. "But Captain de Croix,&mdash;he
was not seriously injured, I trust? Where have the
savages confined him? And know you what they in
tend as to his future?"</p>

<p>"He will forever bear some scars, I fear," I answered,
wondering dully at the calmness of her inquiry.
"I have just left him sleeping quietly in the
council tent. Know you anything of what fate has
befallen other of our friends of the garrison?"</p>

<p>Her eyes grew sad. "Only what little I have
learned through the taunting of my own captor," she
answered, her voice trembling. "Captain Wells is
dead, together with Ensign Ronan and Surgeon Van
Voorhees. Both Captain Heald and his wife were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"> 333 </a></span>
sorely wounded, and they, with Lieutenant Helm, are
prisoners somewhere in the camp; but the Lieutenant's
wife is safe with the Silver-man's family across the
river. The Indians hold these in hope of ransom, and
wreak their vengeance upon the common soldiers who
were so unfortunate as to fall into their hands alive.
Yet few, I think, survived the massacre."</p>

<p>"You have doubtless guessed aright. I noted
with what fearful spirit of revenge the savages dealt
with some of their captives, while sparing others.
Surely you, for instance, have met with but little hardship
thus far at the hands of Little Sauk?"</p>

<p>She glanced up at me, with a touch of the old
coquettishness in her dark eyes and a quick toss of her
head, while one white hand smoothed her soft hair.</p>

<p>"Think you then, Monsieur, I do not look so ill?"</p>

<p>In spite of every effort at control, my heart swept
into my eyes; she must have read the swift message,
for her own drooped instantly, with a quick flutter of
long lashes against her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I have already told you how greatly I admire
you," I faltered, "and you make no less fair a picture
now."</p>

<p>"Then I shall not tempt you to add to your compliment,"
she hastily responded, rising to her feet, "for
I like loyalty in a man better than mere gallantry of
speech. You ask me about Little Sauk. He holds me
for ransom, although Heaven knows 'twill prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"> 334 </a></span>
but waste of time, for I am aware of no one in all the
East who would invest so much as a dollar to redeem
me from Indian hands. Yet such is his purpose, as
told to me this morning."</p>

<p>"Perchance, then," I urged, doubtfully, "you may
prefer remaining quietly here rather than risk the peril
of trying to escape?"</p>

<p>She looked at me keenly, as if in wonder at my
words; and I could see that her eyes were moistening
with the sudden rush of feeling.</p>

<p>"You are either dull of comprehension, John
Wayland," she said, a bit pertly, "or else you understand
me less than any man I ever knew. If I seem
brave and light of heart amidst all this horror, 'tis
merely that I may not utterly break down, and become
an object of contempt. I feel, Monsieur, I am not
devoid of heart nor of the finer qualities of womanhood.
Prefer to remain here? Holy Mother of Christ!
It would be my choice to die out yonder on the prairie,
rather than stay here in these Indian lodges. There
is no peril I would not face joyfully, in an effort to
escape from this place of torture and barbarity. I confess
that an hour ago I cared not greatly what my
end might be; I had lost heart and hope. But now
your coming, as of one risen from the dead, has
brought back my courage."</p>

<p>"You will go, then, whenever and wherever I
say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"> 335 </a></span></p>

<p>She stepped forward with her old frank confidence,
resting both hands in mine, her eyes upon my
face.</p>

<p>"Out yonder in the night, and amid the sand, John
Wayland," she said earnestly, "I remember saying
I would travel with you whithersoever you wished. I
know you far better now than I did then, and I hesitate
not at taking upon myself the same vow."</p>

<p>What power then sealed my lips, I know not.
Doubtless there is a fate in such matters, yet 'tis
strange the light of invitation in her eyes did not draw
me to lay bare my heart. In naught else had I a drop
of coward blood within my veins; while here I hesitated,
fearful lest her pleading face might change to
sudden roguishness, and she laugh lightly at the love
that held my heart in thrall. Truly, the witch had
puzzled me so sorely with her caprices, her quick
change of mood, her odd mixture of girlish frankness
and womanly reserve, that I knew not which might
prove the real Toinette,&mdash;the one to trust, or the one
to doubt. So I stood there, clasping her soft hands
in mine, my heart throbbing, yet my tongue hesitating
to perform its office. But at last the halting words
came in a sudden, irrepressible rush.</p>

<p>"Toinette!" I cried, "Toinette! I could forget
all else,&mdash;our danger here, the horrors of the night
just passed, the many dead out yonder,&mdash;all else but
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"> 336 </a></span></p>

<p>She gave a sudden startled cry, her affrighted eyes
gazing across my shoulder. I wheeled, with quick
intuition of danger; and there, just within the entrance
of the tepee, the flap of which he had let fall
behind him, in grave silence stood an Indian.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE PLEDGE OF A WYANDOT</p>


<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page337_a.png" width="178" height="179" alt="A " />
</span>&nbsp;SINGLE glance told me who
our unwelcome visitor must
be. That giant body, surmounted by the huge broad
face, could belong to none
other than the Wyandot,
Sau-ga-nash,&mdash;him who had
spoken for the warriors of
his tribe before the torture-stake.
He stood erect and rigid, his stern, questioning
eyes upon us, his lips a thin line of repression. With
a quick movement, I thrust the girl behind me, and
faced him, motionless, but with every muscle strained
for action. The Indian spoke slowly, and used perfect
English.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" he said. "Who are you? A prisoner?
Surely you cannot be that same Frenchman we helped
entertain last night?"</p>

<p>"I am not the Frenchman," I answered deliberately,
vainly hoping his watchful eyes might wander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"> 338 </a></span>
about the lodge long enough to yield me chance for
a spring at his throat, "though I was one of his party.
I only came here to bring comfort to this poor girl."</p>

<p>"No doubt she needs it," he replied drily, "and
your way is surely a good one. Yet I doubt if Little
Sauk would approve it, and as his friend, I must speak
for him in the matter. Do you say you are also a
prisoner? To what chief?"</p>

<p>"To none," I answered shortly, resolved now to
venture all in a trial of strength. He read this decision
in my eyes, and stepped back warily. At the same
instant Toinette flung her arms restrainingly about my
neck.</p>

<p>"Don't, John!" she urged, using my name thus
for the first time; "the savage has a gun hidden
beneath his robe!"</p>

<p>I saw the weapon as she spoke, and saw too the
angry glint in the fellow's eye as he thrust the muzzle
menacingly forward. As we stood thus, glaring at
each other, a sudden remembrance made me pause.
"Sau-ga-nash"?&mdash;surely it was neither more nor
less than a Wyandot expression signifying "Englishman."
That broad face was not wholly Indian; could
this be the half-breed chief of whom I had so often
heard? 'Twas worth the chance to learn.</p>

<p>"You are Sau-ga-nash?" I asked, slowly, Toinette
still clinging to me, her face over her shoulder to front
the silent savage. "A chief of the Wyandots?"</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 404px;">

<div class="fig_caption">"Don't John! The savage has a gun hidden beneath
his robe!"</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"> 339 </a></span></p>

<p>He moved his head slightly, with a mutter of acquiescence,
his eyes expressing wonder at the question.</p>

<p>"The same whom the Americans name Billy
Caldwell?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the word used by the whites."</p>

<p>I drew a quick breath of relief, which caused
Mademoiselle to release her grasp a little, as her anxious
eyes sought my face for explanation.</p>

<p>"Recall you a day twelve years ago on the River
Raisin?" I asked clearly, feeling confident now that
my words were no longer idle. "An Indian was
captured in his canoe by a party of frontiersmen who
were out to revenge a bloody raid along the valley of
the Maumee. That Indian was a Wyandot and a
chief. He was bound to a tree beside the river bank
and condemned to torture; when the leader of the
rangers, a man with a gray beard, stood before him
rifle in hand, and swore to kill the first white man who
put flint and steel to the wood. Recall you this,
Sau-ga-nash?"</p>

<p>The stolid face of the listening savage changed,
the expression of revengeful hostility merging into one
of undisguised amazement.</p>

<p>"That which you picture has not left my memory,"
he answered gravely.</p>

<p>"Nor the pledge you gave to that white captain
when he brought you safely to Detroit?" I queried,
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"> 340 </a></span></p>

<p>"Nor the pledge. But what has all this to do
here?"</p>

<p>"Only, Sau-ga-nash, that I am Major David Wayland's son."</p>

<p>The Indian sprang forward, his eyes burning
fiercely; and thinking his movement to be hostile,
I thrust the girl aside that I might be free to repel
his attack. But he did not touch me, merely peering
eagerly into my face with a keen questioning look that
read my every feature.</p>

<p>"You have the nose and forehead," he reflected
aloud; "yes, and the eyes. Before the Great Spirit,
I will redeem my pledge; a chief of the Wyandots
cannot lie."</p>

<p>He paused, and I could mark the varied emotions
that swayed him, so deeply was he moved by this
strange discovery. Unconsciously my hand clasped
Mademoiselle's, for now I felt that our fate hung on
his decision.</p>

<p>"'Tis a hard task, Master Wayland," he admitted
at length, almost wearily, "but for your father's sake
it shall be done. I see only one way for it, and that
by water. Know you anything about the management
of boats?"</p>

<p>"Only as I have paddled upon the Maumee," I
answered, doubtfully, "although I handled a small sail
when a mere boy in the far East."</p>

<p>"'Twill suffice if the fair weather hold, as is likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"> 341 </a></span>
at this season. At least it may be risked. The land
trails are crowded by Indians from far-off tribes, hastening
hither in hope of fight and spoils. More than
a hundred came in to-day, painted for war, and angry
because too late. You could not escape encountering
such parties, were you to flee by trail eastward; nor
would they show mercy to any white. The Silver-man
has returned to his home north of the river; but 'tis
all that we who are friendly to him can do to keep
these warriors from attacking even there. 'Tis the
Indians from far away that make the trouble; and
these grow more numerous and powerful each day.
We keep a guard at the house to save the Silver-man
and his family; and were more whites to seek refuge
there, we should lose all control. There is still safety
at the mouth of the Saint Joseph River, and 'tis there
you must go. The venture must be made to-night, and
by water. Is it known to any Indian that you are alive
and within this camp?"</p>

<p>"To none."</p>

<p>"That is well; we can work best alone. Now
listen. At midnight, Master Wayland, a boat, pre
pared for the trip, will await you, hidden under the
ruins of the Agency building. The river flows under
the flooring deep enough for the purpose, and I will
place the boat there with my own hand. Beyond that,
all must rest upon your own skill and good fortune.
You will wait here," and he glanced about anxiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"> 342 </a></span>
for some means of concealment, "lying behind those
robes yonder, until the hour."</p>

<p>"Here?" I questioned, thinking instantly of my
duty to De Croix. "But I would first have speech
with the Frenchman. He is my friend, Sau-ga-nash.
Besides, I have left my rifle in the council lodge."</p>

<p>The face of the savage darkened, and his eyes
gleamed ominously as they roamed questioningly from
my face to Toinette's.</p>

<p>"I said you were to stay hidden here," he answered
shortly, his tone showing anger, and his hand
pointing at the robes. "Many of the sleeping Pottawattomies
are again astir without, and you could not
hope to gain the council lodge undiscovered. What
care I for this Frenchman, that I should risk my life
to save him? I pledge myself only to Major Wayland's
son; and even if I aid you, it is on condition
that you go alone."</p>

<p>"Alone, say you?" and I rested my hand on Mademoiselle's
shoulder. "I would die here, Sau-ga-nash,
and by torture, before I would consent to go one step
without this girl."</p>

<p>The half-breed scowled at me, drawing his robe
about him in haughty indifference.</p>

<p>"Then be it so," he said mockingly. "'Tis your
own choice. I have offered redemption of my pledge."</p>

<p>I started to utter some harsh words in answer;
but before I could speak, Toinette pressed her soft
palm upon my lips in protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"> 343 </a></span></p>

<p>"Refuse him not," she murmured hastily. "'Tis
the only chance; for my sake, do not anger him."</p>

<p>What plan her quick wit may have engendered,
I did not know; but I yielded to the entreaty in her
pleading eyes, and sullenly muttered the first conscious
lie of my life.</p>

<p>"I accept your terms, Sau-ga-nash, harsh as they
are."</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other of us, his face
dark with distrust and doubt.</p>

<p>"You are not mine to dispose of," he said sternly
to the trembling girl, who visibly shrank from his approach,
and clung once more to me. "You are prisoner
to Little Sauk; nor will I release one thus held
by the Pottawattomies. They and the Wyandots are
brothers. But I trust you, and not the word of this
white man. Pledge me not to go with him, and I will
believe you."</p>

<p>She glanced first at me, then back into the
swarthy, merciless face. Her cheeks were white and
her lips trembled, yet her eyes remained clear and
calm.</p>

<p>"I give you my word, Sau-ga-nash," she said
quietly. "While I am held as prisoner by Little Sauk,
I will not go away with John Wayland."</p>

<p>Little as I believed these words to be true at the
time, the sound of them so dulled me with apprehension
that I could only stare at her in speechless amazement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"> 344 </a></span>
It seemed to me then as if the power of reason
had deserted me, as if my brain had been so burdened
as to refuse its office. I recall that Toinette almost
compelled me to lie down against the farther side of
the lodge, placing a pile of skins in front of me and
assuming a position herself where she could occasion
ally reach across the barrier and touch me with her soft
hand. No doubt she realized the struggle in my mind,
for she spoke little after the departure of the half-breed,
as if anxious to permit me to figure out the
future for myself. Little by little I faced it, and came
to an irrevocable decision. It was to be Toinette or
nothing. While it might be true that she was in no
immediate danger, and possibly could be safely ransomed
if I once escaped to civilization, yet the risk of
such venture and delay was too great; nor would my
love abide so vast a sacrifice on her part. I thought to
say this to her; but there was a look of firm decision
in her sweet face, as her dark eyes met mine, that somehow
held me silent. I felt that in her own heart she
must already know what action I would choose, and
the final moment would prove sufficient test for her
evident determination. Reassured here, my thoughts
turned to De Croix; but that was useless. I could
send no message to him; he was no longer in especial
peril, and perhaps would not willingly desert his newly
found wife even to escape the savages. Nay, it was
to be Toinette and I, now and forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"> 345 </a></span></p>

<p>I do not clearly remember at this day what it was
we spoke about in the brief whispering that passed
between us while we waited there. Neither of us felt
like voicing our real thoughts, and so we but dissembled,
making commonplaces fill the gaps between
our silences. The night found us undisturbed, and it
shut down so darkly within the narrow confines of the
lodge that I lost all trace of her presence, but for an
occasional movement or the sound of her low voice.
Without, the rapidly increasing noise indicated a return
of many savages to the camp, until at last a fire
was kindled in the open space, its red flame sending
some slight illumination where we were, but not
enough to reveal the interior of the lodge. An Indian
brought the girl some food, entering and leaving without
uttering a sound; and we two ate together, striving
to speak lightly in order to make the coarse meal
more palatable.</p>

<p>Suddenly I became aware of a faint scratching
upon the skin of the lodge, at my back. At first I
supposed it to be some wild animal, or possibly a stray
dog; but the regularity of it showed a purpose of some
kind. Could it be De Croix? Or was it the half-breed
with some secret message he dared not deliver openly?
I lifted the lodge covering slightly, and placed my lips
to the aperture.</p>

<p>"Is some one there?" I whispered cautiously
"Who is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"> 346 </a></span></p>

<p>"I am Sister Celeste," came the immediate low
reply. "Are you the white man I guided?"</p>

<p>"Ay," I answered, rejoicing at this rare good for
tune, "and I beg you to listen to what I say. There
will be a boat awaiting us beneath the old Agency
building at midnight. You must be there with De
Croix."</p>

<p>"De Croix?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know not if that be his name to you, but
I mean the Frenchman whose life you saved. Will
you take him thither at midnight, together with the
rifle I left in the council lodge?"</p>

<p>For a moment she did not answer. Doubtless it
was a bitter struggle for her thus to agree even to
meet the man again. At last she made reply, although
I could plainly mark the faltering of her voice.</p>

<p>"The man of whom you speak shall be there," she
said, "unless some accident make it impossible."</p>

<p>As I drew back my head, and sat upright, Mademoiselle
spoke questioningly.</p>

<p>"With whom were you conversing just now,
Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"The young woman of whom we have spoken so
often," I answered thoughtlessly. "She has pledged
herself to bring De Croix to the meeting-place."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she exclaimed, with accent so peculiar
I knew not how to interpret it. "It almost makes me
desire to form one of your party."</p>

echoed, believing I must
have misunderstood her
words. "Surely, Mademoiselle, you cannot mean that
you take your promise to the
half-breed so seriously as
voluntarily to remain in captivity?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I do, Monsieur!" and the tone in which
she said it was firm with decision. "The Indian asked
my pledge in all solemnity, and has gone away trusting
to it. My conscience could never again be clear
did I prove false in such a matter. You also made a
pledge, even before mine was given; was it not your
purpose to abide by it?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, a bit shortly. "I merely agreed
to his proposition at your expressed desire that I
should, and because I believed you had framed some
plan of escape. Have you such small respect for me,
Mademoiselle, as to think I could consent to leave you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"> 348 </a></span>
here alone and at the mercy of these red fiends? Have
I risked my life in coming here for no other end than
this?"</p>

<p>I felt her reach her arm across the pile of skins
lying between us, and grasp my hand within her own.</p>

<p>"But, dear friend, you must!" she said, pleadingly,
her softly modulated voice dwelling upon the words
as if they came hard. "Truly you must, John Wayland,
and for my sake as well as your own. I am
comparatively safe here,&mdash;safe at least from actual
physical harm, so long as the savages dream that the
sparing of my life will yield them profit. You have no
right to remain in such peril as surrounds you here,
when by so doing you benefit no one. You have father
and mother awaiting in prayer your safe return to them
yonder on the Maumee; while I,&mdash;I have no one
even to ask how sad my fate may be. Think you that
because I am a girl I must therefore be all selfishness?
or that I would ever permit you thus to sacrifice
yourself unnecessarily for me? No, no, Monsieur!
I will remain prisoner to Little Sauk, for my sacred
word has been pledged; and you must go, because
there are others to whom your life is of value. Nor
need you go empty-handed, for the one you have
sought so far and long seems now ready enough to
travel eastward with you."</p>

<p>Scarcely had her voice ceased, leaving me struggling
to find fit words to change her mad decision,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"> 349 </a></span>
when a rough hand flung back the entrance flap, and
the naked body of an Indian, framed for a single instant
against the light, lurched heavily through the
opening. Even that brief glimpse told me the man
had been drinking to excess; while for the moment, as
I huddled down closer behind my robes, I was unable
to make out his identity.</p>

<p>"Where white woman?" he ejaculated gruffly, as
he paused, blinded by the darkness. "Why she not
come help me?"</p>

<p>His quick ear evidently caught the slight rustle of
the girl's skirt as she rose hastily to her feet, for with
a muttered Indian oath the savage lurched forward.
I could scarcely make out the dimmest shadow of them
in the dense gloom, yet I seemed to know that he had
grasped her roughly, though not the slightest sound
of fear or pain came from her lips.</p>

<p>"Ugh! better come!" he muttered, a veiled savage
threat growling in his tone. "You my squaw; cook
in my lodge; get meal now."</p>

<p>"But where? and how?" she asked, her voice
trembling perceptibly, yet striving to placate him by a
seeming willingness to obey. "I have nothing here
to cook, nor have I fire."</p>

<p>"Indian squaw no talk back!" he retorted angrily.
"This way I show white squaw to mind chief!"</p>

<p>I heard plainly the brutal blow he struck her,
though even as she reeled back she managed to stifle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"> 350 </a></span>
the scream upon her lips, so that it was barely audible.
With one bound I was over the barrier of robes
and clutching with tingling fingers for the brute. I
touched his feathered head-dress at last, and he must
have supposed me his helpless victim, for with a grunt
of satisfaction he struck once again, the blow meeting
my shoulder, where he judged in the dark her face
would be.</p>

<p>"White squaw mind now&mdash;"</p>

<p>I had him gripped by the throat before he ended,
and we went down together for a death-struggle in the
darkness, from which each realized in an instant both
could never rise again. My furious grip sobered him,
and he made desperate efforts to break free, struggling
vainly to utter some cry for rescue. Once I felt him
groping at his waist for a knife; but I got first clasp
upon its hilt, though I twisted helplessly for some
minutes before I could loosen his hold at my wrist
so as to strike him with the blade. His teeth closed
upon my hand, biting deep into the flesh like a wild-cat,
and the sharp sting of it yielded me the desperate
strength I needed to wrench my hand free, and with
one quick blow the knife I clutched cut deep into his
side, so that I could feel the hot blood spurt forth
over my hand. I held him in a death grip, for I knew
a single cry meant ruin to all our plans, until the last
breath sped, and I knew I lay prostrate above a
corpse. It had been so swift and fierce a contest that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"> 351 </a></span>
I staggered half-dazed to my feet, peering about me as
if expecting another attack. I was steadied somewhat
by the sound of a low sob from the darkness.</p>

<p>"'Tis well over with, Toinette," I murmured
hastily, my voice trembling from the strain that still
shook me.</p>

<p>"Oh, John! John Wayland! And you are truly
unhurt of the struggle?" It was scarcely her voice
speaking, so agitated was it. "Have you killed him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, finding my way cautiously
toward her, and speaking in whispers. "I had no
other choice. It was either his life or yours and mine.
Knew you the savage?"</p>

<p>"It was Little Sauk," she replied, clinging to me,
and growing somewhat calmer from my presence.
"Oh, what can we do now?"</p>

<p>"There remains but one thing, and that is to accept
the chance that Providence has given us. There
remains no longer a shadow of excuse for your staying
here, even by your own reasoning. You are no longer
prisoner to Little Sauk. Your pledge has been dissolved
by Fate, and it must be God's will that you go
forth with me. What say you, Mademoiselle?" And
I crushed her hands in mine.</p>

<p>I could feel her slight form tremble as I waited
her reply, and believed she peered across my shoulder
through the darkness, imagining she saw the dead
Indian's form lying there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"> 352 </a></span></p>

<p>"Do you truly wish it?" she questioned at last,
as though warring with herself. "Think you she
would greatly care?"</p>

<p>'Tis a strangely perverse thing, the human mind.
As there dimly dawned upon me a conception of her
meaning,&mdash;a knowledge that this seemingly heart-free
girl cared enough for me to exhibit such jealousy
of another,&mdash;I would not undeceive her by a word
of explanation.</p>

<p>"I certainly do wish it," was my grave answer,
"nor does it greatly matter what the desire of any
other may be. This is not an invitation to a ball,
Mademoiselle. I beg you answer me; will you go?"</p>

<p>She looked toward me, wondering at my words.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said simply. "Has the time come?"</p>

<p>"I have no certain means of knowing; but it cannot
be far from the hour, and we shall be much safer
without."</p>

<p>I took the Indian's knife with me, wiping the long
blade upon the pile of skins, and placing it convenient
to my hand within the bosom of my hunting-shirt.
It was dark enough back of the lodge away from the
glare of the fires, and we rested there well within the
shadow, for some time, while I scanned the surroundings
and planned as best I might our future
movements.</p>

<p>"Was it from dread of venturing once more upon
the water that you held back so long?" I asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"> 353 </a></span>
her, seeking rudely to delve into the secret of her
reserve.</p>

<p>"Have you ever found me of cowardly heart,
Monsieur?" she questioned in return, parrying with
quick skill, "that you should think any bodily terror
could hold me back? If I had reasons other than those
already given, they were worthy ones."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of the perils before us?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered; "my heart beats fast, but
'tis not from fear."</p>

<p>Only a few scattered lodges had been raised to the
eastward of where we were, nor did these show any
signs of life. We crept forward with painful slowness,
partially hiding our movements by following a shallow,
curving gully, until we had gained the extreme limits
of the encampment, where we crawled out into the
gloom of the surrounding prairie. Not until then did
either of us venture to stand erect, or advance with
any degree of freedom.</p>

<p>Directly ahead of us there was nothing by which
I could safely guide our course. The flat sameness of
the plain offered no landmarks, while the night sky
was so thickly overcast as to leave no stars visible.
Nor was there light of any kind, save that of the fires
in the camp we had just left. I hesitated to risk the
open prairie thus unaided, lest we should wander
astray and lose much valuable time; so, although it
measurably increased our peril of encountering parties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"> 354 </a></span>
of savages, I turned sharply northward, keeping the
bright Indian fires upon our left, and groping forward
through the gloom toward where I knew the main
branch of the river must lie. It was neither the time
nor place for speech. I held her hand closely while
we moved onward silently, carefully guarding each
step lest by mischance it should bring betrayal. Once,
after we had reached the river and were moving eastward
again, a party of Indians passed us, coming so
silently out of the black void, in their soft moccasins,
that I had barely time to hold her motionless before
they were fairly upon us. I counted nine of them,
moving rapidly in single file, like so many black
ghosts. We waited with wildly throbbing hearts, listening
for fear others might follow in their trail.</p>

<p>We were almost beside the walls of the factory
building before either of us was aware of its proximity.
Even then, as I lay prone on the earth and studied its
dim outlines, they possessed nothing of familiarity, for
the high-pitched roof had fallen in and carried with
it the greater portion of the upper walls, leaving a
mere shell, shapeless and empty. I rested there, gazing
at it, and wondering how best we might proceed
to find our way beneath where the boat was to be
moored, when I felt Mademoiselle's fingers press my
arm warningly. Scarcely a yard away, on a ridge of
higher ground, two dim figures came to a sudden pause.</p>

<p>"I perceive naught of the presence of your friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"> 355 </a></span>
as yet, Monsieur," spoke a soft voice, "but I will remain
until certain of the outcome."</p>

<p>"Then your decision is unchanged?" asked the
other, in deeper accent, full of earnest pleading. "All
is to be over between us from this hour? And you
deliberately choose to devote your life to the redemption
of these savages?"</p>

<p>"We have discussed all this at length, Monsieur
le Marquis, as we came along, and, as you fully know,
my choice is made beyond recall. I am here to serve
you to-night, because it seems to be a duty given unto
me by some strange Providence; and I have relied
upon your courtesy to make it as little unpleasant as
possible. I pray you, beseech me no more. The girl
I once was lives no longer; the woman I now am has
been given a special mission by God, too sacred to be
cast aside for aught that earth has to offer her of happiness.
We part in kindness, Monsieur,&mdash;in friendship
even; but that which was once between us may
never be again."</p>

<p>There was no answer; even the reckless audacity
of a courtier was silenced by that calm final dismissal.
It was Mademoiselle who spoke in swift whisper, her
lips at my ear.</p>

<p>"Speak! who is she?"</p>

<p>"The woman of whom you have heard so often,&mdash;the
missionary in the Indian camp."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," impatiently; "but I mean her
name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"> 356 </a></span></p>

<p>"She calls herself Sister Celeste; I have indeed
heard mention of another, but it abides not in my
memory."</p>

<p>"You deceive me, Monsieur; yet I know, and
will speak with her," was the quick decision. "Mother
of God! 'tis a voice too dear ever to be forgotten."</p>

<p>She was beside them with a step, seeming no
doubt a most fair vision to be born so instantly of
the night-shadows.</p>

<p>"Marie Faneuf!" she exclaimed, eagerly. "I
know not by what strange fortune I meet you here,
but surely you will not refuse greeting to an old
friend?"</p>

<p>The girl drew hastily back a step, as if her
first thought was flight; but ere such end could be
accomplished, Mademoiselle had clasped her arm
impetuously.</p>

<p>"Marie!" she pleaded, "can it be possible you
would flee from me?"</p>

<p>"Nay," returned the other, her voice trembling
painfully, as she struggled to restrain herself. "It is
not that. Dear, dear friend! I knew you were among
the few saved from Dearborn. The American hunter
told me, and ever since have I tried to avoid you in
the camp. 'Twas not for lack of the old love, yet I
feared to meet you. Much has occurred of late to
make the keeping of my vow most difficult. I have
been weak, and grievously tempted; and I felt scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"> 357 </a></span>
strong enough, even though protected by prayers, to
withstand also my deep love for you."</p>

<p>Their voices insensibly merged into French, each
speaking so rapidly and low that I could get little
meaning of it. Then I noted De Croix, half lying upon
the ground, his head hidden within his hands. With
sudden remembrance of the work before us, I touched
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come below, Monsieur, and help me search for
the boat," I said, kindly, for I was truly touched by his
grief. "It will help clear your mind to have some
labor to accomplish."</p>

<p>"I dare not, Wayland!" he answered hoarsely,
and the face he uplifted toward me was strangely
white and drawn. "I must stay with her; I dare not
leave her again alone, lest she escape me once more.
She is mine, truly mine by every law of the Church,&mdash;my
wife, I tell you, and I would die here in the wilderness
rather than permit her longer to doom herself to
such a fate as this."</p>

<p>His words and manner were so wild they startled
me. Surely, in his present frame of mind he would
prove useless on such a mission as that before us.</p>

<p>"Then remain here, Monsieur!" I said, "and do
your best to win her consent to accompany us. No
doubt Mademoiselle will aid you all that is in her
power."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">A STUMBLE IN THE DARK</p>


<p class="in_dropcap">
<span class="flt_lt_std"><img src="images/page358_g.png" width="182" height="183" alt="G" />
</span><span class="hidden">G</span>LOOMY as the hole was,
there was no help for it. I
could perceive nothing below, not even my hand when
held within a foot of my
eyes; nor had I the slightest
previous knowledge of the
place to guide me, even had
not the fire ruins above effectually
blocked every passage-way with fallen debris.
Listening however intently, my ears could distinguish
only the faint lapping of the river as it crept about the
log piling on which the house had been built; but
beyond this dim guidance, I had to feel my way forward
with extended hands and groping feet. Swinging
to my back the rifle that De Croix had brought, and
casting an inquiring glance backward at the little
group huddled upon the bank, almost invisible even at
that short distance, I grasped the piling nearest me and
slid down into the unknown darkness.</p>

<p>My feet found solid earth, although as I reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"> 359 </a></span>
out toward the left my moccasin came in contact with
water, which told me at once that only a narrow path
divided the steep bank of the excavation from the encroaching
river. The floor above was originally low,
so that I could easily touch the heavy supporting
beams; and I had felt my way scarcely a yard before
coming in contact with a serious obstruction, where
the weakened floor had sagged so as almost to close
the narrow passage. This caused me to wade farther
out into the water, testing each step carefully as I
followed the sharp curving of the shore-line. I had no
fear of meeting any living enemy within that silent
cave, my sole doubt being as to whether the half-breed
chief had fulfilled his promise and brought the boat, my
gravest anxiety to discover it early and get my party
safely away before the Indian encampment learned
the truth.</p>

<p>I must have reached the apex of the little cove,
moving so cautiously that not a ripple of the water
revealed my progress, and feeling for each inch of way
like a blind man along city streets, when my knee suddenly
struck some obstacle, and seeking to learn what
it might be, I muttered a silent prayer of thanksgiving
as I touched the unmistakable sides of a boat. It was
a lumping, awkward craft, rudely fashioned, yet of a
seeming length of keel and breadth of beam that set
my heart beating with new joy, as I wondered if it
was not the same craft in which the Kinzie family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"> 360 </a></span>
put forth upon the lake the morning of the massacre.
This seemed very likely, for there could hardly be two
such boats at hand, where the Indian water-craft were
slender, fragile canoes, poorly fitted for serious battle
with lake waves. Doubtless this was the only vessel
Sau-ga-nash could find suitable for the venture, or he
would never have chosen it for the use of a single man,
as it was of a size to require the services of several
paddles. Yet the thought meant much; for this very
lack of water-craft was likely to render pursuit by the
baffled savages impossible, if only once we got fairly
away from the shore.</p>

<p>With these reflections driving swiftly through my
brain, I ran one hand hastily along the thwarts of the
boat, seeking to discover if paddles had been provided,
or even a sail of any kind. I touched a coil of rope, a
rude oar-blade so broad as to seem unwieldy, a tightly
rolled cloth,&mdash;and then my groping fingers rested on
the oddest-feeling thing that ever a startled man
touched in the dark. It was God's mercy I did not
cry out from the sudden nervous fit that seized me.
The thing I touched had a round, smooth, creepy feeling
of flesh about it, so that I believed I fingered a
corpse; until it began to turn slowly under my hand
like a huge ball, the loose skin of it twitching yet
revealing no human features to my touch. Saint Andrew!
but it frightened me! I knew not what species
of strange animal it might prove to be, nor whence its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"> 361 </a></span>
grip or sting might come. Yet the odd feeling of it
was strangely fascinating,&mdash;I could not let it go; the
damp flesh-like skin seemed to cling to my fingers in
a horrible sort of magnetism that bound me prisoner,
the cold perspiration of terror bursting from every
pore, even as my other hand, trembling and unnerved,
sought in my shirt for the knife of Little Sauk.</p>

<p>As I gripped the weapon, the thing began to
straighten out, coming up in the quick odd jerks with
which some snakes uncoil their joints after the torpidity
of winter. My hand, finding naught to grasp,
slipped from the smooth round ball, and as it fell
touched what seemed an ear, and then a human nose.</p>

<p>"Merciful God! 'tis a man!" I gasped, in astonishment
and yet relief, as I closed upon his throat,
madly determined to shut off his wind before he could
give alarm.</p>

<p>"Cuss the luck!" he gasped hoarsely, and I let go
of him, scarcely able to ejaculate in my intense surprise
at that familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Burns? For Heaven's sake, Burns! can this
indeed be you?"</p>

<p>For an instant he did not speak, doubtless as
greatly perplexed as I at the strange situation.</p>

<p>"If ye're Injun," he ventured at last gravely,
"then I'm a bloody ghost; but if by any chance ye're
the lad, Wayland, which yer voice sounds like, then it's
Ol' Tom Burns as ye're a-maulin' 'round, which seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"> 362 </a></span>
ter be yer specialty, a-jumpin' on unoffensive settlers
in the dark, an' a-chokin' the life outer them."</p>

<p>The growling tone of his voice was growing querulous,
and it was evident that his temper, never quite
childlike, had not been greatly improved by his late
experiences as an Indian captive.</p>

<p>"But Burns, old friend!" I persisted heartily, my
courage returned once more, "it was surely enough to
stir any man to violence to encounter such a thing in
the dark! What in Heaven's name has happened to
leave you with such a poll? What has become of your
hair and beard? Is their loss a part of Indian torture?"</p>

<p>There was a low chuckle in the darkness, as if the
old rascal were laughing to himself.</p>

<p>"Injun nuthin!" he returned with vehemence.
"Thet's jist my way of sarcumventin' the bloody varmints.
I shaved the hull blame thing soon as ever they
let me loose, an' then played loony, till thar ain't no
Injun 'long the shore as 'd tech me fer all the wampum
in the Illini country. 'Tain't the fust time I saved my
scalp by some sech dern trick. I tell ye, it's easy
'nough ter beat Injuns if ye only know how. By
snakes! I'm sacred, I am,&mdash;specially teched by the
Great Spirit. I tell ye, ter be real loony is dern nigh
as good in an Injun camp as ter hev red hair like thet
thar little Sister Celeste with the Pottawattomies. She
knows her business, you bet; an' so does Ol' Burns
know him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"> 363 </a></span></p>

<p>His mention of her name instantly recalled me to
the little group waiting above us, and doubtless already
worried at my prolonged absence.</p>

<p>"Burns," I interrupted, "this is no time for reminiscences.
I am here seeking some means of escape
out of this place of horror. What were you doing
down here?"</p>

<p>"Sorter contemplatin' a sea v'yage," he said,
dryly. "'Twas rec'mended by my doctor fer the
growth o' my har. So, snoopin' 'round yere in the
dark, an' not over fond o' Injun com'any, I found this
yere boat. Jest got in ter see how 'twas fixed, when
ye jumped down yonder. Reckon I'd kinder like ter
wet 'er up an' see wot she's like."</p>

<p>"Good! so would I. This boat was placed here
for that very purpose. Now listen. The young woman
you just mentioned, that Indian missionary with the
auburn hair, is above yonder, together with another
young white girl rescued from the massacre, and the
Frenchman, De Croix. We have come here, on pledge
of a half-breed chief that this boat would be ready
for our escape. And we have no time to waste, for
we may be followed at any moment."</p>

<p>"They ain't seen ye stealin' outer the camp?"</p>

<p>"No, but in doing it I was compelled to kill
Little Sauk, and the others may find his body at any
time."</p>

<p>For a moment the sly old borderer made no response,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"> 364 </a></span>
and I knew he was quietly turning over the
complicated situation in his own mind preparatory
to intelligent action. I heard him step from the boat
into the shallow water.</p>

<p>"All right, lad! I understand," he said heartily,
his former indifference vanished. "Derned if I
wouldn't jist as soon leave that Parley-Voo behind;
but I'm with ye, an' I reckon Ol' Burns'll give them
thar redskins another dern good jolt. Take hold here,
boy, an' we'll run this yere man-o-war outside, where
we kin ship the rest o' her crew."</p>

<p>The back-water rippling among the old piling was
shallow, but the boat had little aboard and floated
free, so that we worked it forward with little difficulty
until we succeeded in rounding the slight promontory
and held its bulging sides close against the mud wall.
Leaving Burns to keep it in place, I crept silently up
the bank.</p>

<p>"Come!" I whispered, making my way to the side
of Mademoiselle more by instinct than sight. "The
boat we sought is here and ready! I have even found
a boatman to aid us, in the form of Ol' Burns, who,
you remember, aided De Croix and me at the time of
our famous race. Let us waste no more of the night
here, but do the rest of your talking in greater safety
on the water."</p>

<p>They came with me down to the edge of the
stream without a word of protest. I had taken Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"> 365 </a></span>
in my arms and lifted her slight form into the
boat, when she turned suddenly, as if by an unrestrainable
impulse, and held out her hands toward the dim
figure of the silent girl who yet remained motionless
several feet away.</p>

<p>"Marie!" she said, anxiously, "it may be wrong
of me to urge it, but I beg you to think again in this
grave matter. Surely such horrible massacre as you
have witnessed must absolve you from your vow, and
yield you freedom to return eastward with those you
love."</p>

<p>The other did not respond to this passionate appeal,
but stood facing us silent as a statue.</p>

<p>"What mean you, Mademoiselle?" I asked.
"Will not this Sister Celeste consent to leave the
Indians?"</p>

<p>"Nay, she has made a sacred vow of religion
which binds her to this sacrifice. I implore you, John
Wayland, urge her to go with us! 'Tis but waste of
her life here. She is an old schoolmate of mine, and
't will be hard to leave her alone in this wilderness.
Captain de Croix, she was far from being a stranger
to you in those other days at Montreal,&mdash;will you
not add your entreaties to ours?"</p>

<p>I saw him step forward toward that quiet bowed
figure, and she straightened perceptibly, even in the
darkness, as he drew near. His words were in French,
and spoken so low I missed their meaning; yet we all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"> 366 </a></span>
heard plainly her calm answer, while marking the
faltering accents of her lips.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear friend!" and I felt her eyes, blinded
by tears, were seeking out Mademoiselle through the
gloom, "it breaks my heart to answer you nay in this
hour of sore trial to us both. Yet my vow to God is
more sacred than any earthly friendship; nor could
peace ever again abide in my heart were I to break
the vow so lightly. My duty is here, be it for life or
death; and here I must abide until the Master sets
me free."</p>

<p>Then, addressing De Croix, she continued sadly,
"No, Monsieur, the sense of duty that presses upon
me and yields me such strength is beyond your comprehension.
I bid you go back to that world of light
and gaiety you have always loved so fondly, and
think no more of me. To you I am, even as you have
supposed, a dead woman, yet happier far in this sad
exile than I ever was in that gilded social cage where
men laugh while they break the hearts that trust them.
My Indians are indeed cruel, but there is a deeper
cruelty than that of bloodshed, and I prefer the open
savagery of the woods and plains to things I have
known in city life. So it must be good-bye, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>I was looking directly at her when she uttered
these last words of dismissal, yet as she ended she
vanished into the black night beyond, I knew not
how. A moment before, two figures had been standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"> 367 </a></span>
there, De Croix's and hers; and although my eyes
never once wavered, suddenly there remained but one,
that of De Croix, peering forward with bent body as if
he also knew not how or when the girl had vanished
from his side. I was staring yet, half believing it was
but a trick of my eyes, when suddenly, like phantoms
from the mist, a half-dozen naked figures topped the
high bank before me. It was the work almost of a
second. I caught Burns's low cry of warning from
where he sat watching within the boat.</p>

<p>"Run!" I shouted to De Croix. "To the boat,
quick! The savages are upon us!"</p>

<p>He made no motion, and I grasped him. Rarely
have I laid so heavy a hand on one in friendship; but
I lifted him from off his feet and flung him bodily into
the boat's bottom, scarce waiting till he struck before
I had my shoulder against the stern to send the craft
free from shore. I know not what mischance caused
it, whether I slipped upon a stone or tripped over a
hidden root; but as I shoved the boat far out into the
dark current of the river, instead of springing after it,
as I had meant to do, I toppled and plunged headlong
down at the edge of the stream.</p>

</span><span class="hidden">W</span>HAT followed was long a
famous story on the border,
and I have even read it written
out most carefully in
books purporting to tell the
history of those troublous
times. None of them have
it as I recall the details of the
incident, although it all occurred
so rapidly that I myself can hardly tell just how
'twas done.</p>

<p>I know that I scrambled again to my knees, resting
half in the water, my purpose being to fling myself
into the river in an effort to regain the boat. But it
was already out of sight in the dense gloom, while not
the slightest sound reached me for guidance. Beyond
this, I had no time for much save action. Above me,
upon the high bank not three yards away, I saw several
Indian forms peering over; and then others, three or
four, I am uncertain which, sprang lightly down within
a yard of where I crouched in waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"> 369 </a></span></p>

<p>My father gave me a frontier maxim once, which
ran, "If you must fight, strike first, and strike hard."
The words flashed in my memory, and I put them to
the test straightway. These prowling savages were
apparently unaware of my predicament; their sole
thought was with the boat floating away lakeward
down the stream. At all cost, they must be blocked
in any purpose of pursuit. These were the thoughts
that darted through my brain like fire through stubble.
How many opposed me, how desperate would be the
struggle, were matters of which I did not stop to think.
I could at least busy them until the fugitives were
safe; after that, it was God's affair, and theirs. My
rifle was wet and useless from my recent tumble; but
before the group at the water's edge even saw me I
was fairly upon them, striking fiercely with my gun-stock,
and two savages went down, shrieking from
pain and surprise, before so much as a return blow
reached me.</p>

<p>It was not a noisy battle; from the outset it was
too fierce and rapid for any waste of breath. Never
did I need my strength of body more, nor did the long
training of my father come in better play. I made that
long rifle-barrel both club and sword, knife and axe
in one, striking, thrusting, clubbing, in the mad fury
with which desperation bids a man battle for his life.
I had no thought to live, but was determined that if
I went down to earth many a painted savage should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"> 370 </a></span>
lie there with me. The enshrouding darkness proved
a friendly help; for as I backed in closer against the
bank, I gained a fair view of my opponents, while
keeping myself more hidden. Again and again they
charged upon me, joined now by the others from
above; but the circling iron I swung with tireless arms
formed a dead-line no leaping Indian burst through
alive.</p>

<p>Once a hurtling tomahawk half buried itself in my
shoulder; a long-knife, thrown by a practised hand,
pierced the muscles of my thigh, and stuck there quivering,
till I struck it loose; and twice they fired at me,
the second shot tearing the flesh of my side, searing it
like fire. Yet I scarcely realized I was touched, so
fiercely was the battle-blood now coursing through
my veins, so intense the joy with which I crushed
them back. I grew delirious, feeling the rage to slay
sweep over me as never before, giving me the crazed
strength of a dozen men, until I lost all sense of defensive
action, and sprang forth into their midst as
might an avenging thunderbolt from the black sky.
Never had I swung flail in peaceful border contest as
I did that murderous iron bar in the dark of the river-shore,
driving them back foot by foot against the high
bank which held them helpless victims of my wrath.
I struck again and again, my teeth set together in
bulldog tenacity, my breath coming in gasps, the
streaming blood from a deep cut over my eyes half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"> 371 </a></span>
blinding me, yet guided by fierce instinct to find and
smite my foes. I trod on limp bodies, on writhing
forms, and felt my weapon clash against iron rifle
barrels and clang upon uplifted steel; but nothing
stopped me, no cry of terror, no plea for mercy, no
clutching hand, no deadly numbing blow.</p>

<p>God knows the story of that fight,&mdash;how long it
lasted, by what miracle 'twas won. To me it is&mdash;and
was&mdash;little more than a dim haze of strange
leaping figures, of fierce dark faces, of maddened cries
of hate, of uplifted hands, of dull-clashing weapons.
I seemed to see it all through a red fog whence the
blood dripped, and I lost consciousness of everything
save my unswerving duty to strike hard until I fell.
At last out from the maelstrom of that wild <i>mle</i> but
a single warrior seemed to face me; and some instinct
of the fight caused me to draw back a pace and wipe
the obscuring blood away, that I might see him better.
It came to me that this was to be the end, the final
duel which was to decide that midnight battle. He and
I were there alone; and the stars bursting through the
clouds gave me faint view of him, and of those dark,
silent forms that lined the shore where they had
fallen.</p>

<p>A chief, a Pottawattomie, this much I knew
even in that hasty shrouded glance. Writers of history
affirm my opponent was Peesotum, the same
fierce warrior whose cruel hand slew the brave Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"> 372 </a></span>
Wells and wrenched his still beating heart from out
the mutilated body. All I realized then were his
broad sinewy shoulders, his naked brawny body, his
eyes ablaze with malignant hate. He was the first to
close, his wild cry for vengeance piercing the still
night; and before I knew it, the maddened savage was
within the guard of my rifle-barrel, and we were locked
in the stern grapple of death.</p>

<p>It was knife to knife, our blades gleaming dull in
the dim light of the stars, each man gripping the uplifted
wrist of the other, putting forth each last reserve
of strength, each cunning trick of fence, to break free
and strike the ending blow. Back and forth we strove,
straining like two wild animals, our moccasined feet
slipping on the wet earth, our muscles strained, and
sinews cracking with intensity of effort, our breath
coming in labored gasps, our bodies tense as bowstrings.
Such merciless strain could not endure forever,
and, strong as I was in those young days, the
savage was far stronger and less exhausted by the
struggle, so that inch by inch he pressed me backward,
battling like a demon, until I could see the cruel gleam
of his eyes as I gave slowly down. It was God who
saved me, for as I fell I struck the sharp shelving of
the bank, and the quick stoppage swung the savage
to one side and below me, so that, even as he gave vent
to an exulting yell of triumph, wrenching his hand
loose from my weakening clasp to strike the death-blow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"> 373 </a></span>
I whirled and forced him downward, his face
buried in the stream.</p>

<p>Those who write history say the rescuing warriors
discovered him alive. I know not; but this I swear,&mdash;I
held him there until every struggle ceased, until
answering yells from the westward told me others
were already close at hand, and then, breathless and
trembling from the struggle, blinded by blood and
faint from wounds, I sprang forward into the night-shadows,
dimly conscious that my sole hope for escape
lay lakeward. I ran but feebly at first, skirting the
partially destroyed stockade of the old Fort, with its
litter of debris, and stumbling constantly in the darkness
over the obstructions that lined the river bank.
As my breath returned, and I somewhat cleared my
eyes of blood, I saw better; and at last ran from the
darker soil on to the white sand of the beach.</p>

<p>There were now many stars in the sky, with the
moon struggling feebly to break through the haze;
but to my anxious glance nothing was visible upon the
water. Surely the boat must have floated to the river-mouth
by this time,&mdash;surely the force of the current
would have accomplished that; nor was it likely that
Ol' Burns would draw far away from shore until
assured of my fate. The wild shouting told me that
savages from the camp had already found their dead.
A moment more would place them on my trail, hot
for revenge; and there was no course left me but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"> 374 </a></span>
take the water, before their keen eyes found me out.
I waded out, seeking thus to get far enough from shore
to baffle their search, when suddenly a quick spark of
light winked from the blackness in front of me. Surely
it could be nothing less than a signal, the swift stroke
of flint on steel,&mdash;no doubt in the faint hope it would
prove a beacon to me in my need.</p>

<p>Desperate as the chance was, it was still a chance,
and to my mind the only one. I glanced behind; a
dim figure or two dotted the white sand, and my heart
lifted a silent prayer to God for guidance. A second
later I was beyond my depth, breasting the unknown
waters, swimming steadily toward the place where
that mysterious spark had glimmered. Once again it
flashed, the barest glimpse of light through the intense
gloom; and I pressed on with new vigor, certain now it
was a real beacon. But I was so weakened by wounds
and spent from exertion, and such desperate work is
swimming fully clad, that my progress proved slow;
and twice I was compelled to pause, paddling slowly
on my back, in the buffeting of the waves, in order
to gain strength to renew the struggle. I almost lost
heart in the black loneliness, as the swirling water
swept me back and confused me with its ever-tossing
motion. Once I went down from sheer weakness,
choking in a cloud of spray that swept my face; and
doubtless I should have let the struggle end in despair
even then, had not the spark leaped up once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"> 375 </a></span>
through the deep haze; and this time so close was it
that my ears caught the clashing of the flint and steel.</p>

<p>With the new hope of life thus given me, I pushed
grimly forward, using the silent Indian stroke that
never tires, my eyes at the surface level where the
light of the moon glimmered feebly. At last I saw it,&mdash;the
black lumpy shadow of the boat. I must have
splashed a little in my weakness and excitement, for
I plainly perceived the figure of a man hastily leap to
his feet, with an oar-blade uplifted threateningly above
his head.</p>

<p>"Don't strike, Burns!" I managed to cry aloud.
"It's Wayland."</p>

<p>The next moment, with scarce so much as a breath
remaining in my battered body, I laid hand upon the
boat's side, and clung there panting and well-nigh
spent. I felt his hands pressed under my arms, and
then, with the exercise of his great strength, he drew
me steadily up, inch by inch, until I topped the rail,
and fell forward into the bottom of the boat. An
instant I rested thus, with tightly closed eyes, my head
reeling, my breath coming in sobs of pain, every muscle
of my strained body throbbing in misery. Scarcely
conscious of what was being done about me, I could
still realize that arms touched my neck, that my head
was gently lifted to a softer resting-place, and that a
hand, strangely tender, brushed back from my forehead
the wet tangled hair. The touch was thrilling;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"> 376 </a></span>
and I unclosed my wearied eyes, looking up into the
sympathetic face of Mademoiselle. The faint moonlight
rested upon it gently, touching her crown of hair with
silver; and within the dark depths of her eyes I read
clearly the message I had waited for so long.</p>

<p>"Toinette!" I murmured, half conscious.</p>

<p>She bowed her head above me, and I felt a sudden
plash of tears that could not be restrained.</p>

<p>"Do not try to speak now, John!" she whispered
softly, her finger at my lips. "I can only thank the
good God who has brought you back to me."</p>

<p>I made no effort to say more; I could only lie
in silence and gaze up at her, pressing the hands
resting so frankly within my own. Indeed, we needed
no words in that hour; our hearts had spoken, and
thenceforward we were one.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heavy boat lurched beneath us, to
some quick impetus that sent a shudder through every
inch of it; and I heard a heavy splash alongside,
which instantly brought me upright, anxiously grasping
the rail.</p>

<p>"May Heaven help him!" cried Burns excitedly,
and pointing out at the black waters. "The Frenchman
has gone overboard!"</p>

<p>"Overboard?" I echoed, striving to regain my
feet. "Did he fall?"</p>

<p>"Fall? No; it was a dive off the back seat here.
Save me! but he went into it like a gull."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"> 377 </a></span></p>

<p>We sought for him long and vainly, peering over
those dark swirling waters, calling his name aloud, and
striking flint on steel in hope to guide him by the
spark. Nothing appeared along the rolling surface, no
answering cry came from the black void; De Croix
had disappeared into the depths, as desperate men go
down to death. Suddenly, as I leaned over, sick at
heart, peering into the dimness, Toinette drew near
and touched me softly.</p>

<p>"Let us not mourn," she said, in strange quietness.
"No doubt 'tis better so."</p>

<p>"How?" I questioned, shocked at her seemingly
heartless words. "Surely you cannot rejoice at such
a loss?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not a loss," she answered firmly, and the
soft moon-rays were white upon her face. "He has
only gone back to her we left behind; it was the
beckoning hand of love that called him through the
waters. Now it is only ours to pray that he may
find her."</p>

</span><span class="hidden">M</span>Y anxious glance wandered
from the face I so dearly
loved, out where those dark
restless waters merged into
the brooding mystery of the
black night. How unspeakably dreary, lonely, hopeless
it all was! Into what tragic
unknown fate had this earliest
comrade of my manhood been remorselessly swept?
Was all indeed well with him? or had the Nemesis of
a wrong once done dealt its fatal stroke at last? The
voices of the night were silent; the chambers of the
great tossing sea hid their secret well. Had this gallant
and reckless young soldier of France, this petted
courtier of the gayest court in Europe, whose very
name and rank I knew not, succeeded in his desperate
deed? Had he reached yonder blood-stained shore,
lined with infuriated savages, and found safe passage
through them to the side of the woman he had once
called wife, and then forgotten? Or had he found,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"> 379 </a></span>
instead, the solemn peace of death amid the swirling
waters of this vast inland sea, so many leagues to the
westward of that sunny land he loved? These were
the thoughts that shook me, as I leaned out above the
rail, her dear hand always on my shoulder. Never
have the circling years found voice, nor the redeemed
wilderness made answer.</p>

<p>"Possibly it might be done," I admitted slowly.
"'Tis scarce farther than I swam just now, and he is
neither weary nor wounded."</p>

<p>We all realized it was a useless peril to remain
there longer, and I sat at the helm and watched,
while Burns, who developed considerable knowledge
in such matters, fitted the heavy sail in place. With
the North Star over the water for our guidance, I
headed the blunt nose of the boat due eastward into
the untracked waters.</p>

<p>I confess that my memory was still lingering upon
De Croix, and my eyes turned often enough along our
foam-flecked wake in vague wonderment at his fate.
It was Mademoiselle who laid hand softly on my knee
at last, and aroused my attention to her.</p>

<p>"Why did you tell Sister Celeste that you came to
Dearborn seeking Elsa Matherson?" she questioned,
her clear eyes intently reading my face.</p>

<p>"I had even forgotten that I mentioned it," I
answered, surprised at this query at such a time. "But
it is strictly true. While upon his death-bed Elsa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"> 380 </a></span>
Matherson's father wrote to mine,&mdash;they were old
comrades in the great war,&mdash;and I was sent hither
to bring the orphan girl eastward. I sought her as
a brother might seek a sister he had never seen,
Mademoiselle; yet have failed most miserably in my
mission."</p>

<p>"How failed?"</p>

<p>"In that I have found no trace of the girl, and
beyond doubt she perished in the massacre. I know
not how, but I have been strangely baffled and misled
from the first in my search for her, and it was all to
no purpose."</p>

<p>For the first time since I had fallen dripping into
the boat, a slight smile was visible in the dark eyes
fronting me.</p>

<p>"Why hid you from me with such care the object
of your search?"</p>

<p>"I hid nothing, Mademoiselle. We spoke together
about it often."</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed you told me you sought a young
girl, and your words led me to think at first it must
be Josette, and later still the Indian missionary. But
not once did you breathe the name of the girl in my
ears. The dwellers at Dearborn were neither so many
nor so strange to me that I could not have aided you in
your search."</p>

<p>"You knew this Elsa Matherson?"</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that, Master Wayland," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"> 381 </a></span>
returned gravely, her eyes wandering into the night.
"Once I thought I did, but she has changed so greatly
in the last few days that I am hardly sure. A young
girl's life is often filled with mystery, and there are
happenings that turn girlhood to womanhood in a
single hour. Love has power to change the nature as
by magic, and sorrow also has a like rare gift. Do you
still greatly wish to find this Elsa Matherson?"</p>

<p>"To find her?" and I gazed about me incredulously
into those flitting shadows where the waves
raced by. "Ay, for I have dreamed of her as of a
lost sister, and it will sadly grieve those at home to
have me return thus empty-handed. Yet the thought
is foolishness, Mademoiselle, and I understand not why
you should mock me so."</p>

<p>She drew closer, in the gentle caressing way she
had, and found my disengaged hand, her sweet face
held upward so that I could mark every changing
expression.</p>

<p>"Never in my useless life was I farther removed
from any spirit of mockery," she insisted, soberly;
"for never before have I seen the presence of God so
clearly manifest in His mysterious guidance of men.
You, who sought after poor Elsa Matherson in this
wilderness, looking perchance for a helpless orphan
child, have been led to pluck me in safety out from
savage hands, and yet never once dreamed that in
doing so you only fulfilled your earlier mission."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"> 382 </a></span>
I stared at her, grasping with difficulty the full
significance of her speech.</p>

<p>"Your words puzzle me."</p>

<p>"Nay, they need not," and I caught the sudden
glitter of tears on her lashes; "for I am Elsa
Matherson."</p>

<p>"You? you?" and I crushed her soft hand within
my fingers, as I peered forward at the quickly lowered
face. "Why, you are French, Mademoiselle, and of
a different name!"</p>

<p>She glanced up now into my puzzled face, a bit
shyly, yet with some of the old roguishness visible in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"My mother was indeed French, but my father
was an American soldier," she said rapidly, as if eager
to have the explanation ended. "You never asked my
name, save that one night when we first met amid the
sand, and then I gave you only that by which I have
been most widely known. None except my father ever
called me Elsa; to all others I was always Toinette.
But I am Roger Matherson's only child."</p>

<p>It was clear enough now, and the deception had
been entirely my own, rendered possible by strange
chances of omission, by rare negligence of speech&mdash;aided
by my earlier impression that she whom I sought
was a mere child.</p>

<p>"And 'twas Sister Celeste who told you whom I
sought?" I asked, for lack of courage to say more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"> 383 </a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, to-night, while we waited for you beside
the ruins of the old factory. Oh, how far away it
all seems now!" and she pointed backward across the
waters. "Poor, poor girl! Poor Captain de Croix!
Oh, it is all so sad, so unutterably sad to me! I knew
them both so well, Monsieur," and she rested her
bowed head upon one hand, staring out into the night,
and speaking almost as if to herself alone; "yet I
never dreamed that he was a nobleman of France, or
that he had married Marie Faneuf. She was so sweet
a girl then,&mdash;and now to be buried alive in that
wilderness! Think you that he truly loved her?"</p>

<p>"I almost have faith that he did, Mademoiselle,"
I answered gravely. "He was greatly changed from
his first sight of her face, though he was a difficult
man to gauge in such matters. There was a time when
I believed him in love with you."</p>

<p>She tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered, "he merely thought he was,
because he found me hard to understand and difficult
of conquest; but 'twas little more than his own vanity
that drew him hither. I trust it may be the deeper
feeling that has taken him back now in face of death
to Marie."</p>

<p>"You have indeed proved hard to understand by
more than one," I ventured, for in spite of her graciousness
the old wound rankled. "It has puzzled me much
to understand how you so gaily sent me forth to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"> 384 </a></span>
mission that might mean death, to save this Captain
de Croix."</p>

<p>It was a foolish speech, and she met it bravely,
with heightened color and a flash of dark eyes.</p>

<p>"'Twas no more than the sudden whim of a girl,"
she answered quickly, "and regretted before you were
out of sight. Nor did I dream you would meet my
conditions by such a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"You showed small interest as you stood on the
stockade when we went forth!"</p>

<p>"You mean when Captain de Croix and I leaned
above the eastern palisades?"</p>

<p>"Ay, not once did your eyes wander to mark our
progress."</p>

<p>Her eyes were smiling now, and her face archly
uplifted.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Master Wayland, little you know of the
struggles of my heart during that hour. Nor will I
tell you; for the secrets of a girl must be her own.
But I marked each step you took onward toward the
Indian camp, until the night hid you,&mdash;the night, or
else the gathering tears in my eyes."</p>

<p>The sudden yawing of the boat before a gust of
wind drew my thought elsewhere, and kept back the
words ready upon my tongue. When once more I had
my bearings and had turned back the plunging bow,
she sat silent, deep in thought that I hesitated to
disturb. Soon I noted her head droop slightly to the
increased movement of the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"> 385 </a></span></p>

<p>"You are worn out!" I said tenderly. "Lean
here against me, and sleep."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I feel most weary," was her drowsy
reply. "Yes, I will rest for a few moments."</p>

<p>How clear remains the memory of those hours,
while I sat watchful of the helm, her head resting
peacefully on my lap, and all about us those lonely
tossing waters! What a mere chip was our boat in
the midst of that desolate sea; how dark and dreary
the changeless night-shadows! Over and over again
I pictured the details of each scene I have here set
forth so poorly, to dream at the end of a final home
coming which should not be alone. It was with heart
thankful to God, that I watched the slow stealing
upward of the gray dawn as the early rays of light
crept toward us across the heaving of the waters. It
was typical of all I had hoped,&mdash;this, and the black
shadows fleeing away into the west. Brighter and
brighter grew the crimsoning sky over the boat's bow,
where Burns lay sleeping, until my eyes could distinguish
a far-off shore-line heavily crowned with trees.
I thought to rouse her to the glorious sight; but even
as I glanced downward into the fair young face, her
dark eyes opened in instant smile of greeting.</p>

<p>"'Tis the morning," she said gladly, "and that
dark, dark night has passed away."</p>

<p>"For ever, Mademoiselle; and there is even a land
of promise to be seen out yonder!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"> 386 </a></span></p>

<p>She sat up quickly, shading her eyes with her
hand as she gazed with eagerness toward where I
pointed.</p>

<p>"Think you we shall find shelter and friends
there?"</p>

<p>"The half-breed chief said there were yet white
settlers upon the Saint Joseph, Mademoiselle; and the
mouth of that river should be easily found."</p>

<p>She turned toward me, a slight frown darkening
her face.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not call me Mademoiselle,"
she said slowly. "It is as if we were still mere
strangers; and you said Elsa Matherson was to be
as your sister."</p>

<p>I bent over her suddenly, all my repressed love
glowing in my face.</p>

<p>"Toinette!" I whispered passionately, "I would
call you by a dearer name than that,&mdash;by the dearest
of all dear names if I might, for you have won my
heart in the wilderness."</p>

<p>For a single instant she glanced shyly up into my
face, her own crimson at my sudden ardor. Her eyes
drooped and hid themselves behind their long lashes.</p>

<p>"Those who sent you forth seeking a sister might
not thus wish to welcome Elsa Matherson," she said
softly.</p>

<p>"'Tis a venture I most gladly make," I insisted,
"and would seal it with a kiss."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"> 387 </a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes flashed up at me, full of sudden merriment.</p>

<p>"The unpaid wager leaves me helpless to resist,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>The soft haze of Indian summer rested over the
valley of the Maumee. We rode slowly along the
narrow winding trail that hugged the river bank; for
our journey had been a long one, and the horses were
wearied. Burns was riding just in advance of Toinette
and me, his cap pulled low over his eyes, his new
growth of hair standing out stiff and black beneath its
covering. Once he twisted his seamed face about in
time to catch us smiling at his odd figure, and growled
to himself as he kicked at his horse's flanks.</p>

<p>It was thus we rounded the bend and saw before
us the little clearing with the cabin in the centre of its
green heart. At sight of it my eyes grew moist and I
rested my fingers gently upon the white hand that lay
against her saddle-pommel.</p>

<p>"Fear not, dear heart!" I whispered tenderly.
"It is home for both alike, and the welcome of love
awaits you as well as me."</p>

<p>She glanced up at me, half shyly as in the old way,
and there was a mist of tears clinging to the long
lashes.</p>

<p>"Those who love you, John, I will love," she said
solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"> 388 </a></span></p>

<p>It was Rover who saw us first, and came charging
forth with savage growl and ruffled fur, until he
scented me, and changed his fierceness into barks of
frantic welcome. Then it was I saw them, even as
when I last rode forth, my father seated in his great
splint chair, my mother with her arm along the carved
back, one hand shading her eyes as she watched our
coming.</p>

<p>This is not a memory to be written about for
stranger eyes to read, but as I turned from them after
that first greeting, their glances were upon her who
stood waiting beside me, so sweet and pure in her
young womanhood.</p>

<p>"And this, my son?" questioned my father kindly.
"We would bid her welcome also; yet surely she
cannot be that little child for whose sake we sent you
forth?"</p>

<p>I took her by the hand as we faced them.</p>

<p>"You sent me in search of one whom you would
receive even as your own child," I answered simply.
"This is Roger Matherson's daughter, and the dear
wife of your son."</p>

<p>What need have I to dwell upon the love that bade
her welcome? And so it was that out of all the suffering
and danger, forth from the valley of the shadow
of death, Toinette and I came home.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
